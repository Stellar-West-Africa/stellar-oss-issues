Unfortunately, these customizations don't match [SEP-0051](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0051.md). We also currently don't implement the corresponding JSON->XDR cereal overrides. Additionally note that we don't always do a great job of keeping `XDRCereal.h` up-to-date (e.g., not updating to handle [`ContractID`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/commit/039e40eec82915f70dce90a83bd3b07a36dfbe2d)). Also, some of our overrides have data loss, e.g.,\n\n```cpp\nSCAddress addr;\naddr.type(SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE);\naddr.claimableBalanceId().v0().fill(0xff);\n{\n    cereal::JSONOutputArchive ar(std::cout);\n    xdr::archive(ar, addr);\n}\nstd::cout << \"\\n\";\naddr.type(SC_ADDRESS_TYPE_LIQUIDITY_POOL);\naddr.liquidityPoolId().fill(0xff);\n{\n    cereal::JSONOutputArchive ar(std::cout);\n    xdr::archive(ar, addr);\n}\n\n/*\n{\n    \"value0\": \"ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\"\n}\n{\n    \"value0\": \"ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\"\n}\n*/\n```\n\nWhile we could either add these missing overrides, change to match SEP-0051, and fix the broken ones, it seems like it would be easier to just use `rs-stellar-xdr`, instead. I believe none of the JSON serialization should happen on a critical path, so the (likely) performance degradation for serialization of C++ XDR -> Rust -> JSON should be acceptable.",

[this](https://paritytech.github.io/try-runtime-cli/sc_executor_wasmtime/struct.DeterministicStackLimit.html) or [this](https://github.com/near/finite-wasm), rather than relying on the implementation; I expect this would be prohibitively difficult and/or costly, but we can consider it too.)",

In many modern environments it is simpler to use environment variables.

If an environment variable exists with the same name as a field, it is used instead. For tables in the TOML, those are mapped to environment variables per field.\r\n\r\nTo not reinvent the wheel on how to do this, it would be ideal if this worked how tools in the Rust ecosystem have implemented environment variable to toml file mapping:\r\n> Keys are converted to uppercase, dots and dashes are converted to underscores.

      "repoFullName": "stellar/stellar-core",
      "body": "This is a suggestion about something new we could do in core to minimize risks of data consistency issues.\n\n### Background: LedgerTxn\n\nStellar core has a somewhat-centralized system for accessing the ledger called `LedgerTxn` (a.k.a. LTX) which is a sort of nested key/value map (mapping `LedgerKey` to `LedgerEntry`) that is used for several overlapping purposes:\n\n1. Atomic commit/rollback (with exception safety) of multiple simultaneous changes.\n2. Batching and caching accesses to the underlying database and/or buckets.\n3. Minimizing the risk of data consistency errors.\n\nThis third task is subtle and the source of a lot of the complexity of the LTX: doing a lookup on an LTX produces a `LedgerTxnEntry` object, which is _not_ a raw `LedgerEntry`. The `LedgerTxnEntry` is instead a special smart pointer type that can be _invalidated at a distance_ by the ltx it came from. In particular when a parent LTX opens a child LTX, all existing `LedgerTxnEntry`s issued by _past lookups on the parent_ are dynamically invalidated, wherever they may be. Any attempt to read or write through them will fail (dynamically, at runtime).\n\nThe _purpose_ of it is to avoid two types of data inconsistency that can arise if a child LTX has newer entries than its parent:\n\n1. Stale reads from the parent LTX that should be hidden by the child LTX's newer entry.\n2. Lost writes to a parent LTX entry that will be overwritten by the child LTX's newer entry.\n\nThe purpose is good! But the _implementation_ of this leaves some things to be desired:\n\n1. It makes use of destructors in a way that's not very obvious to the user. A lot of users don't know when they can or should call `.current()` on a `LedgerTxnEntry`.\n2. It is relatively easy to accidentally subvert by capturing a reference to the underlying `LedgerEntry` in a local.\n3. The implementation is quite confusing and involves a _lot_ of code and complexity for just this one task.\n4. The implementation is tightly coupled to the `LedgerTxn` class itself, and does nothing to prevent similar inconsistencies in contexts where we don't or can't use the `LedgerTxn` class (eg. when operating directly on bucket lists and snapshots, or in the new parallel apply subsystem).\n\n### Alternative: LedgerEntry context IDs / provenances\n\nI propose we explore alternative designs to the LTX, not necessarily replacing it wholesale (or not yet) but as a first step factoring out the _purpose_ of its inconsistency-prevention system into a separate _mechanism_ that:\n\n1. Is much simpler and has much less machinery\n2. Is easier to understand, more explicit, and harder to accidentally misuse\n3. most importantly: we actually _can_ use everywhere we use `LedgerEntry`s, not just in LTXs\n\nThe mechanism I have in mind has two pieces:\n\n1. A `LedgerEntryContext` class that is lightweight and can either be separately inherited-from or manually instantiated anywhere there's a conceptual collection of `LedgerEntry`s that need to be guarded against stale reads or lost updates. This class contains a _number_ (no complex pointer types) that we arrange to uniquely identify the context in the code (exact mechanism of assigning numbers TBD; some mix of static and dynamic numbering, but assume there's some way of uniquely numbering them). We can call these \"context IDs\" or \"provenances\" depending on your taste.\n2. A `LedgerEntryWrapper` class that _directly contains_ a  `LegerEntry` and so can be passed to and from functions, put in standard container types, buffered, cached, etc. etc. Additionally, this class carries the number of a context that the wrapper is associated with (it is set on construction).\n\nThese two pieces would collaborate to dynamically check a similar condition: that nobody reads or writes entries \"in a context they shouldn't\". Contexts need not be containers! Or if they are containers, they need not be containers shaped exactly like a map from keys to values (for example bucket lists and eviction iterators are more like just sequences or lists of entries).\n\nI can think of at least 3 mechanisms of enforcement of such \"context-sensitive access\":\n\n1. In order to _read from_ or _write to_ the `LedgerEntry` inside a `LedgerEntryWrapper`, a method like `context.unwrap_read(wrapper, [](LedgerEntry const&) { ... })` or `context.unwrap_write(wrapper, [](LedgerEntry&) {...})` needs to be called on a context. This method checks the context numbers match before allowing access and throws if they do not. Since it takes a closure it's less immediately easy to capture the reference in a local variable (it's not impossible -- at some level there's no way to prevent it -- but it's a little harder!)\n2. Contexts may want to activate or de-activate themselves entirely -- masking off the possibility of _any_ access to a parent context while a child is open -- the same way LTXs do, with parent/child relationships tracked by a helper flag/method/destructor if needed. But not all contexts we're concerned about have a direct parent/child coupling in the call tree the same way LTXs do, so this might not be the only way of using them.\n3. The assignment `operator=` of `LedgerEntryWrapper` may also want to contain a dynamic check that the assigned number matches the existing number, such that writing back a `LedgerEntryWrapper` to a container will fail unless the numbers match. For this to work there needs to either be a (partial?) order on numbers such that child-context entries _can_ overwrite parent-context entries when being committed-back to them, or else if numbers are opaque there needs to be a way to _intentionally_ re-home a bunch of wrappers (eg. by calling a method `wrapper.set_context(new_context)` on all of them before writing back.\n\n### Longer term: the LTX itself\n\nThe LTX is a bit of a maintenance concern. The code is very complex, it is strictly sequential (not parallel friendly), I am very unsure of its exception-safety logic, much of it is now semi-redundant with the parallel apply path and the underlying bucketlist (which already does its own caching and batching), and its SQL caching and batching function (or SQL-access mediation at all) is no longer used for anything other than the orderbook.\n\nWhile I do not want to dismiss the extent to which the orderbook is still a central use-case, I think it could be a healthy de-risking of the future of LTX client code to start finding ways to accomplish the remainder of what the LTX does without actually needing it. Or alternatively to refactoring its implementation to \"meet the same goals\" with a simpler internal implementation. I believe that if the LTX implemented this `LedgerEntryContext` interface, LTX client code could fairly easily be ported over to it piece by piece, after which a lot of the internal complexity of the LTX could be eliminated (retaining the pieces it needs to function as a transactional nested map and cache of orderbook state, again at least for now). I think this could even eventually make room for a standard tx-apply path that doesn't use the LTX at all -- only the new parallel apply machinery -- if we could find a parallel-friendly answer for the orderbook.",

By using a fast timeout, the network will elect 2+ leaders: the unresponsive node(s) and a responsive node. The tradeoff is that there may be multiple values on the network when the unresponsive node(s) become responsive again. However, this will resolve itself once those nodes are marked responsive again.\n\nThis solution may also indirectly help with situation (2) as asymmetric quorums will lead to some nodes with differing quorum sets being marked unresponsive, and therefore multiple nodes will win leader election and the probability of the network agreeing on a leader will increase. However, it's worth discussing whether a more direct solution exists here.",

This is beneficial for anyone wanting to sign without having direct access to the private key (and thus cannot produce the required KeyPair), such as when using a cold wallet or using a secret shared private key. \r\n\r\n### What would you like to see?\r\nThe signing algorithm requires hashing the TransactionEnvelope, which is currently a private property (envelope) of the Transaction type. Once this envelope has been hashed and signed, this has to be set in the transaction, something that also cannot be done (without using clone(...) of txnbuild/transaction). Therefore, adding either a way of getting the envelope directly (like done [here](https://github.com/Pownieh/stellar_go/blob/8682b386febf735239031167cdf24971dce0d47f/txnbuild/transaction.go#L295-L297)), or adding a specific way of getting the hash of the envelope and then afterwards setting the signatures, would allow someone to implement their own signing protocol. \r\n\r\n### What alternatives are there?\r\nAlternatives to the two approaches described above include injecting once own signing function directly and likely other options.

Thanks! -->\r\n\r\n### What problem does your feature solve?\r\nThe `CheckpointChangeReader` type in the `ingest` package describes itself as a change reader, but really it only returns a complete snapshot of a checkpoint and not changes between checkpoints.\r\n\r\nIf an application is using checkpoints only for data and ingests a checkpoint at ledger X, and wishes to get the changes introduced in ledger X+64, the application will read the entire ledger state for ledger X+64 instead of only the changes that occurred. In this situation the `CheckpointChangeReader` will unnecessarily download and decode buckets that haven't changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What would you like to see?\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the `CheckpointChangeReader` updated to:\r\n- Accept a starting ledger, which must also be a checkpoint ledger.\r\n- Only download buckets that have changed between the two ledgers.\r\n- Return ledger key deletes from the Read() endpoint.\r\n\r\nI think this will probably require a change to the `Change` type as well because it assumes that any change we know about will include a complete view of the before (`Pre`) and after (`Post`) view of the ledger, which isn't the case in checkpoint ledgers, especially deletes where we will only know the ledger key of the item.\r\n\r\nAs part of experimenting with the `ingest` package (which is awesome by the way 🎉 👏🏻) I tried writing a small service that collects diffs between checkpoints using the changes above. An initial download of the entire ledger state takes about 2 minutes, and then reducing future downloads to changed buckets reduces that ingestion time to under 8 seconds, sometimes as small as milliseconds.\r\n\r\nMy hacky experimentation can be seen in this diff, if you look at the `ingest/checkpoint_change_reader.go` file: https://github.com/stellar/go/compare/master...leighmcculloch:frontier?w=1#diff-35c98eb7c476b5de267f7dc78959ec274fefe0c8726c59897ba1c56590c3017f.\r\n\r\n### What alternatives are there?\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new reader that does this.",

When replaying from history, validators do not close ledgers by witnessing SCP messages, and as a consequence do not upload SCP messages for some ledgers\r\n\r\n### What would you like to see?\r\n\r\nArchivist should allow repairing SCP archives by:\r\n* at a minimum copy SCP files from other archives\r\n* better is to merge SCP files from archives. Merging here would have to be done in such a way that \r\n\r\n### What alternatives are there?\r\n\r\nA subset of this may be doable by modifying core to download SCP messages from other archives when replaying from history.\r\nI am opening an issue there as \"archivist\" is more about fixing things up after the fact and core should just produce archives with enough information in the first place.\r\n",

The stdlib got new errors functions that support natively wrapping and unwrapping errors. We should use them to make our code more friendly to generic Go code. Even the original author of pkg/errors has stated he no longer uses the packages and this extra layer distances us from writing code that is understandable by an average Go developer because our errors just work that little bit different and causes our errors to behave in subtly different ways to native errors.\r\n\r\n### Concerns\r\nThe pkg/errors errors give us stack traces with our errors, while stdlib errors still do not. This has been an area lacking consensus and so I doubt stdlib errors will gain stack traces soon. We shouldn't do this assuming stack traces might show up in a future release. If this is something we find extremely valuable we should probably not do this.",

It checks if the given price is a valid Stellar amount using regexp:\r\nhttps://github.com/stellar/go/blob/04ac85c94afe1fbb24e850601812f4c791926b24/price/main.go#L20-L26\r\nhttps://github.com/stellar/go/blob/04ac85c94afe1fbb24e850601812f4c791926b24/price/main.go#L41-L47\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is incorrect. Requirement for amounts to have at max 7 decimal places comes from the way stellar-core keeps amount values internally (`int64` in stroops which is 10<sup>-7</sup> XLM). There is no such limitation on string representation of the price.\r\n\r\nThe regexp check appeared in the code around the time when we received security report about possible DoS vector when parsing amounts using [`amount.Parse`](https://godoc.org/github.com/stellar/go/amount#Parse) function. The argument value was passed directly to `big.Rat.SetString` which can start extensive calculations on values like `1E9223372036854775807` (note: `E`). This behaviour was incorrectly incorporated into `price.Parse` because it's using `big.Rat.SetString` internally too.\r\n\r\nWhen fixing this issue we should remember about this DoS vector. Specifically, we should check what's the maximum number of decimal places we can allow to ensure low CPU usage.",

SEP-8 is one example. Payment channels has a flow that will require it as well where a prior signed transaction stored as XDR will need reparsing, modifying, and resigning.\r\n\r\n",

We could update the implementation so that it fetches the offer from horizon before compiling the delete operation, but this will take an additional network request.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I think we should introduce a new method that takes in the full offer (and not just offerID) so the SDK has enough information to construct the delete operation correctly out of this. Here's the expected implementation of such a function:\r\n```golang\r\n//DeleteOfferOp returns a ManageSellOffer operation to delete an offer, by\r\n// setting the Amount to \"0\". The sourceAccount is optional, and if not provided,\r\n// will be that of the surrounding transaction.\r\nfunc DeleteOfferOp(offer ManageSellOffer, sourceAccount ...Account) (ManageSellOffer, error) {\r\n\tif len(sourceAccount) > 1 {\r\n\t\treturn ManageSellOffer{}, errors.New(\"offer can't have multiple source accounts\")\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tnewOffer := ManageSellOffer{\r\n\t\tSelling: offer.Selling,\r\n\t\tBuying:  offer.Buying,\r\n\t\tAmount:  \"0\",\r\n\t\tPrice:   offer.Price,\r\n\t\tOfferID: offer.OfferID,\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tif len(sourceAccount) == 1 {\r\n\t\tnewOffer.SourceAccount = sourceAccount[0]\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn newOffer, nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nthat the SDK would not modify the assets in the offer.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nthe sdk modified the assets in the offer.",

Configure OAuth providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).\r\n   - Obtain necessary API keys and credentials.\r\n2. **Implement Frontend Login Flow:**\r\n   - Create a login button for each OAuth provider.\r\n   - Redirect users to the provider's authentication page.\r\n   - Handle the OAuth callback and retrieve user information.\r\n3. **Integrate OAuth Authentication on Backend:**\r\n   - Implement backend endpoints to handle OAuth authentication.\r\n   - Validate and store OAuth tokens securely.\r\n   - Create or update user records based on OAuth data.\r\n4. **Ensure Secure Handling of OAuth Tokens:**\r\n   - Implement best practices for storing and managing OAuth tokens.\r\n   - Ensure secure transmission of tokens between frontend and backend.\r\n\r\n### Create and Store a Key Pair After Signing in with OAuth\r\n\r\n#### Account Creation\r\n1. **Generate Key Pair:**\r\n   - After the user signs in using OAuth, generate a public and private key pair.\r\n   - Use a secure method to generate these keys, ensuring they are unique and sufficiently random.\r\n\r\n2. **Display Key Pair:**\r\n   - Display the generated public and secret keypair to the user.\r\n   - Provide an option for the user to regenerate the keypair if they prefer.\r\n\r\n3. **Encrypt and Store Secret Key:**\r\n   - Prompt the user to enter a pincode to encrypt their secret key.\r\n   - Use a strong encryption algorithm (e.g., AES) to encrypt the secret key before storing it in the browser’s localStorage.\r\n\r\n#### User Experience\r\n1. **Secure Key Management:**\r\n   - Inform the user that their encrypted secret key will only be stored locally in their browser.\r\n   - Emphasize that the key will not be shared with any server or third parties.\r\n\r\n2. **Confirm Pincode:**\r\n   - When the user submits their pincode, confirm it by encrypting a sample data and verifying it can be decrypted correctly.\r\n\r\n#### Code Implementation: Key Pair Management\r\n\r\n1. **Svelte Store for Key Pair:**\r\n   - Create a Svelte store to handle the user's keypair.\r\n   - Use the js-stellar-wallets SDK to manage key encryption and decryption.\r\n\r\n2. **Store Key Pair:**\r\n   ```javascript\r\n   import { persisted } from \"svelte-local-storage-store\";\r\n   import { KeyManager, KeyManagerPlugins, KeyType } from \"@stellar/wallet-sdk\";\r\n   import { error } from \"@sveltejs/kit\";\r\n   import { get } from \"svelte/store\";\r\n\r\n   function createWalletStore() {\r\n     const { subscribe, set } = persisted(\"walletStore\", {\r\n       keyId: \"\",\r\n       publicKey: \"\",\r\n     });\r\n\r\n     return {\r\n       subscribe,\r\n\r\n       register: async ({ publicKey, secretKey, pincode }) => {\r\n         try {\r\n           const keyManager = setupKeyManager();\r\n\r\n           let keyMetadata = await keyManager.storeKey({\r\n             key: {\r\n               type: KeyType.plaintextKey,\r\n               publicKey: publicKey,\r\n               privateKey: secretKey,\r\n             },\r\n             password: pincode,\r\n             encrypterName: KeyManagerPlugins.ScryptEncrypter.name,\r\n           });\r\n\r\n           set({\r\n             keyId: keyMetadata.id,\r\n             publicKey: publicKey,\r\n             devInfo: {\r\n               secretKey: secretKey,\r\n             },\r\n           });\r\n         } catch (err) {\r\n           console.error(\"Error saving key\", err);\r\n           throw error(400, { message: err.toString() });\r\n         }\r\n       },\r\n\r\n       confirmCorrectPincode: async ({ pincode, firstPincode = \"\", signup = false }) => {\r\n         if (!signup) {\r\n           try {\r\n             const keyManager = setupKeyManager();\r\n             let { keyId } = get(walletStore);\r\n             await keyManager.loadKey(keyId, pincode);\r\n           } catch (err) {\r\n             throw error(400, { message: \"Invalid pincode\" });\r\n           }\r\n         } else {\r\n           if (pincode !== firstPincode) {\r\n             throw error(400, { message: \"Pincode mismatch\" });\r\n           }\r\n         }\r\n       },\r\n\r\n       sign: async ({ transactionXDR, network, pincode }) => {\r\n         try {\r\n           const keyManager = setupKeyManager();\r\n\r\n           let signedTransaction = await keyManager.signTransaction({\r\n             transaction: TransactionBuilder.fromXDR(transactionXDR, network),\r\n             id: get(walletStore).keyId,\r\n             password: pincode,\r\n           });\r\n           return signedTransaction;\r\n         } catch (err) {\r\n           console.error(\"Error signing transaction\", err);\r\n           throw error(400, { message: err.toString() });\r\n         }\r\n       },\r\n     };\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   export const walletStore = createWalletStore();\r\n\r\n   const setupKeyManager = () => {\r\n     const localKeyStore = new KeyManagerPlugins.LocalStorageKeyStore();\r\n\r\n     localKeyStore.configure({\r\n       prefix: \"walletApp\",\r\n       storage: localStorage,\r\n     });\r\n\r\n     const keyManager = new KeyManager({\r\n       keyStore: localKeyStore,\r\n     });\r\n\r\n     keyManager.registerEncrypter(KeyManagerPlugins.ScryptEncrypter);\r\n\r\n     return keyManager;\r\n   };\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Creating the Account on the Stellar Network\r\n\r\n#### Fund Account\r\n1. **Fund with Friendbot (Testnet):**\r\n   - Use Friendbot to fund the new account with Testnet XLM for testing purposes.\r\n   ```javascript\r\n   import { server } from \"./stellarServer\";\r\n\r\n   export async function fundWithFriendbot(publicKey) {\r\n     console.log(`Requesting Friendbot funding for ${publicKey}`);\r\n     await server.friendbot(publicKey).call();\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Using the Wallet Store\r\n1. **Pincode Confirmation:**\r\n   - Use the wallet store throughout the application to handle user pincode confirmation and transaction signing.\r\n   - Integrate the wallet store with UI elements like confirmation modals.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Outcome:**\r\n- Users can log in using their social media accounts.\r\n- Secure and seamless OAuth authentication flow.\r\n- Properly stored and managed OAuth tokens.\r\n\r\n**Why This Is Important:**\r\nOAuth authentication provides a convenient and secure login method for users, enhancing user experience and potentially increasing user engagement.\r\n",

Thanks! -->\r\n\r\npre-req: #150 \r\n\r\n### What problem does your feature solve?\r\n\r\nThe [Getting Started tutorial](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/smart-contracts/getting-started/create-an-app) has you create a frontend app using\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsoroban contract init --frontend-template https://github.com/stellar/soroban-astro-template\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat frontend template is nice, because it expects that it was used with `soroban contract init`, and that it thus has a `contracts` folder with an unknown set of contracts in it. It's made in a generic way to allow you to quickly get started with any of those contracts.\r\n\r\n_This_ repository, on the other hand, has a hard-coded list of contracts. It also has a fairly built-out UI that interacts with them, using an opinionated atoms/molecules/organisms component organization approach.\r\n\r\n### What would you like to see?\r\n\r\nThis repository should function a bit more like a template. Maybe it can still have a hard-coded example contract, because it does have some interesting custom behavior around event subscriptions (see the `useSubscription` hook) that's hard to figure out on one's own.\r\n\r\nThe idea of these templates is that anyone can create them, and then perhaps SDF can create a community program for template maintainers to receive funding for creating and keeping up these templates. We could also list these somewhere in our docs, or encourage a naming strategy that makes them easy to find on GitHub. Perhaps at that point, this repo could be transferred to a community maintainer, rather than being part of the official `stellar` org.\r\n\r\nGiven that the \"official\" template uses vanilla JS, via Astro's templating system, and this one uses Next.js and React, it probably makes sense to continue to have both on offer, since which one chooses is a matter of preference.",

What you've put together here with Solidity is so much simpler, nicer, and easier to work with than the Anchor framework for developing programs and I'm immensely grateful for all the work you've put in.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a critical security vulnerability in the Solang compiler that enables an attacker to craft arbitrary state variables and pass them to the program, which are then deserialized and acted upon as if they were legitimate.\n\nThis has far-reaching implications for all Solana programs generated with Solang, which can no longer trust the contents of their account variables.\n\nI've put together a quick demonstration in this repository: https://github.com/ivypowered/solang-owner-not-validated\n\nThank you and have a great day!",

The function called with `try` does *not* have a return value:\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract A {\r\n    function try_catch_func_require() public view returns (uint) {\r\n        try T(address(1)).t() {\r\n            return 2;\r\n        } catch Error(string memory reason) {\r\n            return 1;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ncontract T {\r\n    function t() public view  {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case 1, the `Try` statement looks like the following:\r\n```rust\r\nfn print_try(t: Statement) {\r\n    let Statement::Try(loc, func_expr, maybe_return, maybe_catches) = t else { unreachable!()};\r\n    println!(\"{func_expr}\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\nit looks like the following:\r\n```solidity\r\nT(address(1)).t(0, 101)\r\n```\r\nIt is just the function call (this makes sense!)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn case 2 (without a function return specified), it looks like the following: \r\n```solidity\r\nT(address(1)).t(0, 101){return 2;}\r\n```\r\ni.e. it is a `FunctionCallBlock`\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally this actually seems truly unintended per the docs:\r\n```\r\nTry(Loc, Expression, Option<(ParameterList, Box<Statement>)>, Vec<CatchClause>)\r\n\r\ntry <1> [returns (<2.1>,*) <2.2>] <3>*\r\n\r\n<1> is either New(FunctionCall) or FunctionCall.\r\n```\r\n\r\nedit: I may have misunderstood the docs, and it may be that it can be a lalrpop FunctionCall not an `Expression::FunctionCall`, which would make sense because it could be named args function call. Still, its a bit weird to have to special case try blocks that have a function return vs those that dont\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`Try`'s first expression should always either be `New(FunctionCall)` or `FunctionCall`. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Hyperledger Solang version**\r\nSolang-parser v0.3.3\r\n",

      "body": "Currently, TS transpilation process converts TS source files into CommonJS modules compatible with older NodeJS versions. The problem is that such structure doesn't support bundler's (e.g. WebPack, Rollup) tree shaking and deduplication mechanisms. The whole SDK package is bundled in a single huge module regardless of the code actually utilized in an application.\r\n\r\nPlease check the following screenshot for the illustration. There's a `stellar-base` chunk modules at the bottom and a monolith `stellar-sdk` module at the top (which contains full duplicate bundled versions of `stellar-base`, `js-xdr` and other dependencies). The difference is that `stellar-base` relies on ES6 source code that supports bundler optimizations natively. Naturally, if the project or any of its dependencies contain a `stellar-base` package reference, the output bundle will always contain two duplicates of `stellar-base`, often causing weird problems, not to mention a monstrous bundle size.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/assets/33724849/c3a36728-d267-4b0a-8a22-1b5aa79bbe5c)\r\n\r\nSome work has been done on this problem in [this commit](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/commit/bb7f443cc51bf56c24bf3274a5021cd4c3c14d60) (kudos to @Shaptic). However, this doesn't solve the problem completely. \r\n\r\nA straightforward solution for this problem is to transpile TS code of `stellar-sdk` to ES6 modules during the package deployment phase. Probably, it's possible to achieve this by setting [`module`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#module) to `ES2020` or `nodenext` and [`moduleResolution`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) to `bundler` or `nodenext` in the `tsconfig.json`. This might also require an additional webpack compilation step to bundle a special separate module for NodeJS, but it looks like these settings should work just fine as-is for all NodeJS versions > 16 (currently, LTS is v20), so it should be safe to use these settings targeting both NodeJS and browser environments.",

(possibly rewrite js-xdr to ts-xdr?)\r\n  \r\n- Another possible path: JSON => XDR. However, there is concern on performance (need to bundle) and also technical lift. Short term, we could potentially add a .toJSON() method to convert \r\n\r\n### Exploratory Ideas\r\n- sunset xdrgen? \r\n- what are other tools for *.x to Typescript or JSON with types\r\n- XDR -> Rust -> Typescript?  https://github.com/kochavalabs/xdr-codegen \r\n\r\nWe should timebox this spike to no more than 1 sprint. \r\n",

The generated code is dependent on the js-stellar-sdk. The code generated is a thin layer on-top of the js-stellar-sdk, because the js-stellar-sdk actually contains most of the logic for generating types and clients at runtime for the contract and the code generation just provides typescript types.\n\nThe existing architecture requires coupling the stellar-cli to a specific js-stellar-sdk, or coupling the cli to a set of js-stellar-sdk versions.\n\nThe code gen would benefit from moving closer to the js-stellar-sdk. Since the code generator generates code directly dependent on the js-stellar-sdk, and the code generator is intended to be used by developers who are already using the SDK, I think it makes sense to move the code gen into the js-stellar-sdk.\n\nBenefits:\n- The developers maintaining the js-stellar-sdk would maintain the code generator, requiring less engineers to coordinate or be across changes to both.\n- The code generator would always be compatible with the version of the js-stellar-sdk the developer is using.\n- Developers could use older versions of the js-stellar-sdk with newer versions of the stellar-cli without concern for breakage or subtle changes to generated code.\n- The version of the code generator would be managed by the JS tooling, so for JS developers they have less to manage to maintain reproducible builds.\n\nCons:\n- It might be considered a con to need to write a contract spec parser in JS, however contract specs are just XDR stored in a wasm section. Wasm sections can be natively extracted using JS APIs. And the js-stellar-sdk library contains an XDR decoder, so these tasks are very accessible to the tooling being built here.\n- Other than the small effort to port the existing command, I don't see any, please share in a comment if there are cons.\n\nDependent on:\n- https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/issues/1978",

There’s more useful info in the response, though:\n\n```\nretry: 1000\nevent: open\ndata: \"hello\"\n\nevent: err\ndata: sql: no rows in result set\n```\n\n…but to get it, you'd also have to listen for the `err` event:\n\n``` js\nvar paymentStream = [payments query].stream({\n    onmessage: function(payment) { /* handle payment */ },\n    onerror: function(error) {}\n  });\npaymentStream.addEventListener('err', function(event) {\n  console.log('Error:', event.data);\n});\n```\n\n…which is both a little inconvenient and hard to discover (no docs). It might be nice if the `onerror` handler was called when `err` events occur (even though `EventSource.onerror` is generally intended for network errors). Barring that, this should at least be documented—and perhaps the object passed to `CallBuilder.stream()` could take a handler for it.\n\nAdditionally, the server closes the connection after this error, but that just causes the event stream to attempt to reconnect and you get the same error over and over again (the basic idea of the EventSource API is that any kind disconnect not explicitly requested by the client was a network interruption of some sort and a reconnect should be attempted).\n\nI imagine there could be some rare scenario where Horizon might send an error in the middle of the stream and keep going, but maybe if an `err` event is immediately followed by a disconnect, the client should hang up? Or Horizon could perhaps send some kind of \"end of stream\" event to indicate that the client should hang up/not retry.\n",

I believe I figured it out.\r\nIt looks like environment where auth transaction is being created is milliseconds ahead of my local clock, so when transaction is created by the endpoint and is being checked locally, it arrives before my local Date.now(), which causes this issue.\r\nWhen I slow my internet connection to 3g (emulation in developer tools) it starts working.\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose a change to buildChallengeTx function\r\ninstead of\r\n```\r\ntimebounds: {\r\n        minTime: now,\r\n        maxTime: now + timeout,\r\n      },\r\n```\r\ncreate it with \r\n```\r\ntimebounds: {\r\n        minTime: now - 5000, \r\n        maxTime: now + timeout,\r\n      },\r\n```\r\nto avoid this issue with clock synchronization\n\n---\n\n@shanzzam commented on [Fri Jul 16 2021](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-demo-wallet/issues/205#issuecomment-881779172)\n\n@s-a-y I can move this issue for you. The demo wallet uses the js-stellar-sdk code so will move to that repo. First, I'd like to get feedback from the engineers who worked on the wallet as they may be fixing this issue. @piyalbasu or @quietbits any comments before I move this issue?\n\n---\n\n@quietbits commented on [Mon Jul 19 2021](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-demo-wallet/issues/205#issuecomment-882547667)\n\n@shanzzam moving this issue to `js-stellar-sdk` sounds good. 👍 The fix wouldn't be on the demo wallet.\n\n",

The `test-wasms` directory in stellar-cli contains somewhat-modified examples contracts, such as a `hello_world` contract with increment behavior. We will need to change the tests that expect this to instead test the two separate contracts. (Or, honestly, if you look over the tests and decide we don't need both, then we can remove some tests.)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe could add `soroban-examples` as a git submodule.\r\n",

If your SDK would also require breaking changes to implement this check, comment on this issue and we discuss the viability of different options.\n\nIf your SDK has implemented and released these changes, reference the release in a closing comment.",

I particularly refer to a timeout error from horizon, i.e, a 504 status with `\"title\": \"Timeout\"`. The only mention of this error I found is [here](https://github.com/stellar/go/blob/395aedcf0af932bd39b086d22a1828a807aedf52/services/horizon/internal/docs/reference/errors/timeout.md) and [here](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-base/blob/master/src/transaction_builder.js#L135). The former is very hidden and the latter is part of the official SDK documentation but it is stated in a way that it suggests that this error only needs to be treated if `setTimeout` is used – which is not true. This error can happen for every submitted transaction.\r\n\r\nThis error is rather fatal: in a scenario where someone implements [Stellar channels](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/channels.html) and is not aware that this 504 error needs to be treated in a specific way, a failed transaction might be given back to a pool of source accounts and be retried with a different source account and therefore a fresh sequence number. Then, e.g., a payment transaction is executed repeatedly unbeknown to the implementor.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nDescribe all possible error scenarios for `submitTransaction` and how to treat them appropriately. This should also be added to the horizon API documentation or refer to it. Such a description of error scenarios should preferably be added to the other API requests to horizon, too.\r\n",

This is repetitive effort in any project using the SDK. This is also difficult to do across a decent sized application as the cache in one component may not be directly align with another.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd like to see an option to specify functionality that sits between the request the SDK is going to make and the fetch call such that a developer can insert a cache at that point, rather than having to cache the final set of objects.\r\n\r\nIdeally this could be the specifying of a function on a call builder that gets called whenever a request is made which under one condition can return the response data, or can call through to the next step, sort of like outgoing middleware.\r\n\r\nIdeally this function could also be set on the StellarSdk.Server and passed to all call builders.\r\n\r\nThis idea is inspired by Go's HTTPClient RoundTripper, which allows specifying a custom RoundTripper.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI'm also exploring writing a cache that sits on-top of a call builder but I think that is a lot harder to maintain, and it won't be possible to cache all requests because the SDK returns objects with functions attached that automatically make additional requests when called. For example, when calling `.operation()` on an effect the operation is lazily loaded using a request. For this reason I don't think it is possible to implement a complete cache on-top of the SDK.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI've been using the js-stellar-sdk in a side project that requires making a lot of calls to a Horizon instance.\r\n",

      "body": "Currently in Stellar, if a Key K exists on an Account A and an Account B with full privilege, then a transaction sourced from A with an operation from B requires a single signature.\r\n\r\nWhile this is not inherently insecure, it adds a number of edge cases that make it difficult to verify behavior in cases where a key is required for different reasons within a transaction. Some of these attacks result around selecting the same key as another participant (without their checking) and others of these are resultant from from cryptographic manipulations (e.g., choosing a PKb' such that PKb' = PKb - PKa which breaks certain types of aggregation). \r\n\r\nFor example, suppose we have a protocol with three participants, Alice, Bob, and Carol. There is an account R which has signers Alice, Bob, Carol, and then an account A, B, and C, which require Alice, Bob, and Carol singularly. Our goal is to distribute to A and B and C three operations which affect account R with A and B and C as the sources, such that they can all occur independently. We want the property that B and C cannot run the operation from A's account, and so on. In the naive protocol, the signer's of R sign all three transactions, and then Alice, Bob, and Carol only sign them when they intend to broadcast them. However, the naive version is broken -- after being signed by the signers of R, each of the transactions are usable. There are two fixes to make the protocol secure in the current model: either Alice and Bob sign the transaction from Carol's account, and then give it to Carol (so Carol never share's her signatrue) and so on for Alice and Bob; or Alice, Bob, and Carol use a distinct key for their account A and the account R.\r\n\r\nWe can add some new constraints to Accounts and Signers that generally add a context for the signature that prevents these kinds of mistakes. While generally there are mechanisms that fix these vulnerabilities through stronger preconditions or smarter protocols, adding a couple low-level features will make it easier to address.\r\n\r\nI propose few different mechanisms to force signatures to have context. In some cases, this means a single key must sign different values multiple times. All of these can be opt-in at the transaction, account, or signer level. They are somewhat redundant, so not all are needed.\r\n\r\n1) Require signers to specify which account they are signing on behalf of\r\n2) Assign a random IV or Tweak to a key depending on when it was added (e.g., H(ledger hash when added || public key || operation # in ledger || account id)). Signatures must use that IV/tweak for it to count against that account\r\n3) Require signatures to include an index of which # signer they were (first, second, third, etc). This is not too difficult to do, first sort on Account ID then sort on PK.\r\n4) Only allow a unique signature to satisfy one threshold equation\r\n5) Require signatures to specify how many obligations they should be satisfying. Default is one\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not wild about any of these measures, so I'm opening it up for general discussion before making a more concrete proposal.\r\n\r\n",

For every transaction, a percentage of the sent amount is redirected to a specified fee pool account separate from the issuing account. This can be in addition to the XLM transaction fee.\r\n1. The fee pool is distributed later, and transactions involving the issuing account and fee pool account are exempt from the fee.\r\n1. Working accounts can also be made exempt through an account whitelist.\r\n1. An initial fee rate is specified when the asset is issued, but can be adjusted by the issuing account. The rate can be set at least as precisely as '0.01%'.\r\n\r\nAppreciate any thoughts or feedback about this. Thanks!",

If client code relies on certain timing, it won't work.\r\n\r\nA nice thing about this solution is that it's basically how standard order books work (be it \"good for day\" or \"good until cancelled\" that really means 30 or 60 days for most brokerage firms).\r\n",

      "body": "The time is come for us to resolve one of the niggling issues left in the new stellar network:  How the API and client libraries deal with numbers that represent an \"amount\" in a transaction.  Example amounts:\n- How much of a given asset will be sent in a payment\n- How much of a given asset will be offered for trade\n- How much of a given asset held by an account\n\nPresently, stellar-core represents these amount as a 64-bit unsigned integer and interprets the number in no other way: It's always using integer math.\n\nHowever, by convention we say that uint64 is actually a fixed-place decimal number with 7 digits of precision.  I'm proposing that we bake this convention into horizon and the client libraries.\n\nTo do this, and to gain the most compatibility between language-specific representations and the json representation communicated by horizon, I propose that we should encode amounts as a string containing a decimal number.  Some example side effects of this change:\n1.  Amounts in horizon would go from being json numbers to strings:\n\n``` json\n{\n                \"amount\": 50000000.0,\n                \"asset_type\": \"native\",\n}\n```\n\nwould become:\n\n``` json\n{\n                \"amount\": \"5\",\n                \"asset_type\": \"native\",\n}\n```\n1.  The ruby client library would assume the 7 fixed-place decimal representation of any numbers passed into it from user code:\n\n``` ruby\ntx = Stellar::Transaction.create_account({\n  account:     master,\n  destination: destination,\n  sequence:    1,\n  starting_balance:  50 * Stellar::ONE\n})\n```\n\nWould become:\n\n``` ruby\ntx = Stellar::Transaction.create_account({\n  account:     master,\n  destination: destination,\n  sequence:    1,\n  starting_balance:  50  # or '50' or BigDecimal.new(50)\n})\n```\n",

This routine could be implemented at stellar-core level, saving wallets implementors from this redundant task and making them more likely to implement it right in the first place.\r\n\r\n2. Additional signers should be recorder in the block chain:\r\n* There's use cases where it does matters who signed, beyond the fact that the threshold have been met.

      "body": "feature request\r\n\r\nMy startup is trying to build licensed securities as smart contracts on Stellar. We have a working proof-of-concept for an asset-backed-loan on the Stellar test net. However before we can move to the livenet there are a number of features not currently available that we need to figure out a way to provide.\r\n\r\nIn the recent Stellar 2018 roadmap post it was mentioned that one of the top priorities is SDEX and getting more financial instruments like the ones I am trying to build onto stellar. During the process of building our POC I found that there are a number of features currently missing that prevent Stellar from fully being used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nI'm willing to help contribute to the development of these features but I've only been working with the Stellar api a few weeks so I would really appreciate some guidance so that I can contribute in a way that is in harmony with the current spirit of the stellar codebase.\r\n\r\nI see a lot of potential in stellar with trustlines, the ability for anybody to issue an asset, and pathfinding. Stellar can be much more than just a cryptocurrency. With the changes I am requesting Stellar will be able to support a much wider ranger of financial instruments and I am hoping I can get some assistance and advice in how to implement them.\r\n\r\nThings I am looking for:\r\n\r\n1. More granularity with the security thresholds. For example I can set different thresholds for different operations, but all payments count under the same operation. So I can't for example authorise an employee to be able to sign transactions up to a total of 10k usd per month, and if he wants to go above that he needs another sig. Or another usecase would be to authorise the employee to make any transaction that exchanges btc for usd, but if he wants to transfer usd out of the account he needs to get another sig. I know some of this functionality can be approximated by using multiple accounts. But I think this is not a great solution, as for non developers it is very hard for them to keep track of all these accounts, especially if you are trying to sell a security on stellar and every time you transfer a security you transfer 4-5 accounts at the same time and the amounts in those accounts are all changing programatically over time.. it is not ideal.\r\n\r\n2. Right now you can make an offer that exchanges one asset for another asset, but you cannot make an offer for a transaction that contains multiple operations. Jed talks about one way to implement securities in his blog (http://jedmccaleb.com/blog/bonds-on-stellar/) and in this blog he talks about \"signing and making public a transaction\" but not submitting it yet. AFAIK there isn't really a marketplace for transactions yet? Maybe that is already on the roadmap for SDEX? The ability to make an offer for a transaction instead of just a basic token swap would be very useful for many types of financial instruments. This part doesn't necessarily have to be on chain but I think it would be nice for SDEX to be able to provide this functionality.\r\n\r\n3. Right now you have to specify the amounts that are to be transferred in the transaction at the time that the transaction is created and signed, not at the time that the transaction is submitted. So for example if I want to sell a bond that contains eth-backed tokens as collateral, and it's supposed to make monthly repayments of usd based on the exchange rate between eth and usd at the time of the payment, there isn't really a way to do that. Another example use case is if I have a financial instrument that is supposed to pay out based on a floating rate based on some index.\r\n\r\n4. Also while there is some conditional logic that is possible by creating multiple transactions with the same sequence number, currently whichever transaction gets submitted first is the one that gets accepted. It would be nice to be able to specify more conditional logic on what allows a transaction to be submitted other than the time bounds. An example would be a transaction that can only be submitted if the eth/usd exchange rate goes below a certain threshold.",

      "body": "This idea has side effects related to \"dead accounts\", \"true cold storage\", \"sharding accounts\", and \"ensuring what Horizon sent me was what the Core SCP actually agreed on\" that I think are pretty useful.\r\n\r\nA few of us noticed that the Horizon SDK clients have little way of ensuring a Horizon endpoint sent the actual balances of an account, versus whatever it felt like sending.  This led to my considering a way for the \"Core\" to sign the current whole account state and have Horizon send that along with the rest of the account details (recipient can then validate the data wasn't tampered with by the man-in-the-middle).\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to add a \"core signature\" and \"core signer\" field to an account.\r\n\r\nWhen an effect modifies something material on an account, like a \"subentry\", or most of the account's property fields, the proposing node also generates a \"Sign Account\" effect and computes the signature for the account's new, whole, state and supplies its own peer ID as the \"core signer\".  This \"Sign Account\" effect would be the last step in a transaction to sign every account that was modified this txn (This could even be pushed out to being part of the \"Ledger Close\" instead if that's an option).\r\n\r\nWhen the SDK does a \"LoadAccount()\" it can validate the \"core signature\" on the account to  ensure the client received what the core agreed to via the SCP by checking it with the public key associated to the \"core signer\".\r\n\r\nThis assumes that the clients have a reliable method of obtaining an accurate list of public keys for the core signers (aka they didn't come from the cracked Horizon node that simply replaced these new fields too); or that the client retrieve the account's signature from multiple servers to compare several of them.\r\n\r\nIn my mind's eye the signature would include anything that counts as a \"subentry\" on the account.\r\nThis likely means \"account details\" on Horizon would be increased to include the \"Offers\" list so that all the subentries on the account were returned with the account query and the signature properly checked.\r\n\r\nSo how does this signature help?\r\n- You can now do a \"real\" _cold storage_ for an account.  By leaving only the account signer/signature records in the database; you can delete the rest of the account from the database.  When/If the account is ever \"reloaded\" you check that the data being reloaded matches the signature / signer data on record.\r\n\r\n- It validates to the receiving client, that the client received what the core has agreed to\r\n\r\nBut it has some interesting other uses too:\r\n\r\n- This means you can \"remove\" _dead accounts_.  While they are \"removed\" they carry no reserve requirement for accounts that might be paying the reserve fee for the account.\r\n\r\n- The account can't be transacted with from or to; so while the account is \"offline\" it can't be changed in any way.\r\n\r\n- The account details cannot be looked up directly.  You can always recompute them through transaction history, but the account status is simply \"offline\" or \"unavailable\" (you can confirm it exists).\r\n\r\n- This enables \"sharding\" of account processing across the core collective.  Since it'd no longer be required for a database to hold all data for every account; all nodes can hold only the signatures and signers for every account.  They can then request on demand the data for accounts they'd like to participate in.  The algo for determining this is a separate discussion; here I'm saying that account sharding by the core is enabled if the account states are signed, and the signature agreed to by the SCP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks all!  I appreciate the consideration.\r\nMike\r\n",

      "body": "This proposal would add a new `extraSignerKeys` field to the transaction header that would allow a transaction to specify extra conditions that must be satisfied for the transaction to be valid.\r\n\r\nThe field would be an array of `SignerKey`s. (`SignerKey` is the type of the `key` property used in the [Signer](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/7767d3ef44e9e409fb17dd68f62c276bc0086726/src/xdr/Stellar-ledger-entries.x#L73) object (which in turn is used in the [SetOptions operation](#https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/7767d3ef44e9e409fb17dd68f62c276bc0086726/src/xdr/Stellar-transaction.x#L129)). These signer keys could be public keys, sha256 hashes, or preauthorized transaction hashes (although the latter would be impossible to satisfy, since this field is itself incorporated into the transaction hash).\r\n\r\nThe transaction envelope would have to include signatures or preimages satisfying each of those extra signers, in addition to those satisfying the signers on the source account.\r\n\r\nThe total number of signers (between both signers on the account and extra signers on the transaction) cannot be higher than 20.\r\n\r\nIf one of the signers is not satisfied, the transaction would fail with code TX_BAD_AUTH.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThis allows preauthorized or presigned transactions to specify additional conditions that must be satisfied at the time that they are spent.\r\n\r\nSomething like this is necessary to implement the hashed timelock contracts (HTLCs) used in multi-hop payment channel networks like Lightning. These require presigned or preauthorized transactions that can only be spent if a certain hash preimage is provided. Currently, you can set a hash preimage as a signer on an account, which is enough to implement a single HTLC in a payment channel. However, it appears to currently be impossible to extend this solution to multiple HTLCs in a single channel, because each hash preimage should only be allowed to authorize one specific transaction.\r\n\r\nThis could also be useful for escrow-like functionality, where a semi-trusted third party has approval power over one specific transaction. Others have noted the absence of this functionality: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/issues/1329.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nTransactions are [already designed to be extensible](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/7767d3ef44e9e409fb17dd68f62c276bc0086726/src/xdr/Stellar-transaction.x#L330):\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct Transaction\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    // reserved for future use\r\n    union switch (int v)\r\n    {\r\n    case 0:\r\n        void;\r\n    case 1:\r\n        SignerKey* extraSignerKeys<20>;\r\n    }\r\n    ext;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nSignatures satisfying each of the extra signer keys must be provided in the `signatures` field of the transaction envelope, along with the signatures required for the source account and any operations involving other accounts.\r\n\r\nThese signatures would be checked at the same time the signatures for the source account are checked.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\n* Define this as a new operation (something like \"`Satisfy`\") instead of a new transaction-level field. This would require looking for and evaluating this operation in the first stage of transaction validation (at the same time as signatures, fees, and sequence numbers are checked), which is not how operations typically work (in my understanding).\r\n\r\n* Change the evaluation of transactions so that when the signers or weights are changed mid-transaction, the changed permissions are applied to subsequent operations in that transaction. While intuitive, this would likely be a more disruptive change that could break presigned or autogenerated transactions. Additionally, this check, too, would have to be done in the first stage of transaction validation (since the transaction should not be added to the chain at all, or bump the sequence number, if it is unauthorized), which is different from how operation failures typically work.\r\n\r\n## Backwards compatibility\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking consensus change (although it's probably what we would call a \"soft fork\" in the blockchain context).\r\n\r\nSince this adds a field and does not change or remove any fields, it probably will not break any applications or user code, although it will require updates to the SDKs.",

To sign a specific Transaction Envelope, a signer includes the Merkle Path and the top level signature.

In this case, protocols should add code to support 'existential spend path fee reduction' (if someone demonstrates a transaction they intend to broadcast with a SimulSig from you requiring a large lookup, you cooperatively provide a regular signature of that transaction). \r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nThis thread is for discussing how we can adopt invariants to a much higher degree than today.\r\n\r\n# Terminology and background\r\n\r\nInvariants were added in version 9.0.0 as opt-in.\r\nMost invariants are checks enforced at the operation level. When invariants fail, an error is logged.\r\n\r\nHard invariants are invariants that when they fail cause the instance to crash. \r\n\r\nInvariants are a form of insurance against bugs: assume that bugs will be encountered, but when it happens ensure that the impact of those bugs is as small as possible.\r\n\r\n# Goals\r\n\r\n## Primary goal\r\nProgressively turn all operation level invariants into \"protocol level invariants\" to protect the integrity of the ledger when encountering bugs network wide.\r\n\r\n## Secondary goal\r\nAllow custom invariants to be enforced on some validators (not network wide) while preserving network liveness, this is also how \"staging\" of new invariants can be implemented before invariants become \"protocol invariants\".\r\n\r\n## Non-goals\r\nEnable invariants that are not transaction or operation level invariants.\r\n\r\nThe only invariant that we have right now in that category is `BucketListIsConsistentWithDatabase`, which is already a \"hard\" invariant (that crashes the node) when enabled.\r\nThis invariant is only enforced when applying buckets during catchup and is designed to detect corruption of the node.\r\nAs this invariant is enforced outside of consensus it cannot be considered \"protocol level\".\r\n\r\n# Approach: make transactions \"fail\"\r\n\r\nHere \"protocol level invariants\" would \"fail\" transactions with the error code `txINTERNAL_ERROR`.\r\n\r\nThis is fairly easy to implement as the functionality was already put in place to deal with unknown runtime errors without crashing the instances.\r\n\r\nPotential issues with this solution are:\r\n* if an operation corrupts core's internal state of ledger yet causes a different transaction to fail invariants, the \"blame\" goes to the wrong transaction.\r\n   * This may sound like a far fetched example, but bugs in caching subsystems will tend to manifest themselves like this.\r\n   * A potential (weak) mitigation for this is to\r\n       * clear all caches at periodic intervals - for example, clear caches when closing a ledger.\r\n       * monitor (alarm) when an invariant trips (monitoring should be enabled regardless)\r\n       * assume that the chance of running into such a situation is low enough that we don't have to address this directly \r\n* the transaction failure is recorded in history, this is a problem if the invariant failure didn't blame the right transaction.\r\n\r\n## Optional invariants\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nOptional invariants need to be enabled differently:\r\n* If enabled to fail transactions, the failure mode would not be desirable as the local node would corrupt their local state (compared to the rest of the network), and\r\n   * publish this \"1 ledger fork\" to downstream systems\r\n   * would fall out of sync on the next SCP round as it would not agree with the \"previous ledger hash\" (causing the node to stop contributing to the network)\r\n* the bad ledger would also be published to downstream systems such as Horizon (this is a general problem with how to deal with forks).\r\n* The only recovery would be to reset the instance a mechanism to \"rollback\" a validator to the previous ledger to resolve this issue.\r\n* If enabled as \"hard invariants\", there is a risk of crashing the entire network.\r\n\r\n### Approach\r\n\r\nOptional invariants would be enabled in such a way that optional invariants would be checked *after* protocol level invariants (so that protocol level invariants would trigger first) and would not cause the results to be different from a node not running without any optional invariants enabled.\r\n\r\nThe difference would be in what happens when an optional invariant fails, the validator would:\r\n1. trip a \"fuse\" persisted in its database (as it closes the ledger)\r\n2. with the fuse blown, it would\r\n    * report in metrics and the info endpoint that an invariant failed\r\n    * stop sending SCP messages\r\n    * stop publishing to txhistory and related tables and instead only publish into \"holding tables\"\r\n         * during normal operation, the flow would be to publish to holding tables and publish to txhistory (from holding) delayed by a ledger. Note: during normal operating mode, transactions get therefore confirmed not in 0-5 seconds as in now, but in 5-10 seconds (delayed by 1 ledger).\r\n         * this leverages the same tech than the one used to mitigate the effect of a \"1 ledger fork\" type of situation\r\n         * alternate solution here could be to mark historical entries (ledger headers, txhistory, etc) with a new property (flag \"invariant_failed\" that indicates downstream systems to potentially halt ingestion) but\r\n            * this would require the pub/sub semantics to change as to allow publishing data for duplicate ledgers (when clearing the fuse)\r\n            * would require downstream systems to deal with bad data\r\n    * continue to perform its duties wrt history archive as normal\r\n\r\nRecovering from a tripped invariant would require running a command that would reset the fuse to a clean state and would also unblock historical data.\r\n\r\nAs the node stops voting there is a chance that the network halts if too many nodes had the same optional invariant enabled - as the node is actually watching the network but just not voting, resetting the fuse and forcing the node to send its SCP message (that was withheld) should allow to unblock the network.\r\n\r\n# Other approaches that were considered\r\n\r\n## Crash the node\r\nCrashing the node seems to be the simplest approach at first glance: it's simply makes protocol invariants \"hard invariants\" which stops stellar-core from closing the ledger when failures are detected.\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, core aborts, crashing the node and leaving it at the previous ledger (rolling back any partial changes to the database if necessary).\r\n\r\nIn addition to leaving the ledger in a \"last known good\" state, it also guarantees that downstream systems such as Horizon never see \"bad\" transactions that failed invariants.\r\n\r\nThe difference between a protocol level invariants and optional invariants would just be in the scope of the number of validators that would crash as protocol level invariants are enforced by all nodes.\r\nOptional invariants could be enabled instead as described in \r\n\r\nIssue with this approach is that if the invariant failure affects a v-blocking set (which is the case for protocol level invariants as it effects all nodes), the entire network is crashed.\r\n\r\nThe recovery from this type of failure can be tricky as the transaction set committed by the various validators (SCP) contains a sequence of transactions that caused the invariant failure.\r\n\r\nTo recover from such a crash, a fix for the root cause of the invariant failure needs to be deployed to all validators.\r\n\r\nOptimistically speaking with this approach we're looking at a downtime in the order of days which is not acceptable.\r\n\r\nSchemes to somehow skip transactions from the transaction set therefore need to be established.\r\n\r\nCorruption of internal state of the ledger may cause crashes (failed invariant) even though bad transactions were processed in earlier ledgers.\r\n\r\n## Skip the entire transaction set\r\n\r\nWhen encountering a protocol level invariant failure, the validator would:\r\n1. Rollback any changes (if necessary) made by applying transactions (including ledger header)\r\n2. Construct an empty TransactionResultSet to indicate that the ledger didn't apply transactions\r\n3. Apply upgrades (if any)\r\n4. Trigger a new ledger right away\r\n5. \"ban\" transactions that were included in the transaction set for the next X ledgers\r\n    * Banning transactions means not voting for transaction sets that include those transactions\r\n\r\nIssues with this approach are:\r\n* An attacker can DoS the network by constantly submitting transactions that violate invariants\r\n* Complexity in properly implementing \"ban\"\r\n\r\nCorruption of internal state of the ledger may cause skipping of arbitrary ledgers.\r\n\r\n## Skip transactions\r\n\r\nInstead of skipping the entire transaction set, we can imagine marking transactions that fail invariants with a new special result (`txSKIPPED`) that indicates that the transaction was skipped entirely.\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, `txfeehistory` and `txhistory` would not contain information about skipped transactions (but history would) - this would isolate downstream systems from having to deal with \"duplicate\" transactions (as those transactions can be resubmitted in the future).\r\n\r\nIssues with this approach are:\r\n* An attacker can DoS the network by submitting bad transactions with a high fee that use up all \"slots\" in the transaction set, knowing that the fee would not be processed\r\n* Complexity in properly implementing \"ban\"\r\n* Complexity from having to redo fee processing and apply all other transactions (basically rollback, redo everything after removing transactions)\r\n* Need to reconcile skipped transactions with consensus\r\n\r\nCorruption of internal state or of the ledger may cause skipping of arbitrary transactions.\r\n\r\nA variation for skipping transactions is to skip those during consensus which would avoid having to add the new `txSKIPPED` result.\r\n\r\nThe implementation would require the same type of logic than out of consensus (requiring additional validation during consensus that could be expensive) and would still be subject to the same DoS attack if done only during Ballot Protocol.\r\n\r\nIf done for all transaction sets during nomination it may work but the performance impact might be too high as extra validation is equivalent to \"applying\" the transaction set many times over.\r\n\r\n## Reject transactions upstream (can potentially done with all solutions)\r\n\r\nIn order to minimize (but not eliminate) the chance of running into invariant failures during consensus, it might be possible to validate transactions by actually \"applying\" them (without committing) when:\r\n* They get submitted by the \"tx\" end point\r\n* Encountering a transaction for the first time (when receiving a transaction set during consensus for example)\r\n\r\nFor this to scale properly:\r\n* Transaction validation would have to be run in parallel\r\n* Transaction validity would have to be cached until the next ledger close (both positive and negative)\r\n\r\nThis may also help with smart contracts that submit single transactions to the network .\r\n",

Under Promise Reserve, reserve obligations are lazily enforced.\r\n\r\nMotivating example: create account, move assets, then merge:\r\n```\r\nOperations: [\r\n    CreateAccount {address: a, starting_balance: 0},\r\n    ChangeTrust {source: a, asset: ..., limit: 1000},\r\n    Payment { destination: a, amount: 1 },\r\n    ChangeTrust { source: b, asset: ..., amount: 0},\r\n    AccountMerge {destination: b},\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis currently can fail because we need the reserves for account B and B's trustlines, and we need A to be set up before we can remove B. This requires us to over-collateralize the operation.\r\n\r\nIf instead we do something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n Operations: [\r\n    PromiseReserves(1.5 XLM),\r\n    CreateAccount {address: a, starting_balance: 0},\r\n    ChangeTrust {source: a, asset: ..., limit: 1000},\r\n    Payment { destination: a, amount: 1 },\r\n    ChangeTrust { source: b, asset: ..., amount: 0},\r\n    AccountMerge {destination: b},\r\n]\r\n```\r\nwe can then check after executing all operations that the reserves were eventually covered.\r\n\r\nThis helps simplify proposals like ATP3 (sep-16).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe want this to be explicit rather than just changing existing behavior because there are situations depending on the old behavior. The old behavior can also sometimes be useful -- this is why the operation is slightly better than the transaction type, as you can be more fine grained with where and when reserve debts are opened or closed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of implementation, it should be fairly easy to make something like this backwards compatible as in effect, promisereserves is just a new type of payment that goes through always but encumbers a debt on the entire transaction.\r\n\r\nAnyways, just opening up for discussion here for now.",

It also makes it impossible to have long standing smart contracts which pay to trustlines.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trustline itself may also require Authorization, in which case this operation should either automatically require an Allow Trust or should be paired with an allow trust.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpening for discussion now.",

It's also problematic because if A fails, then B still exists.\r\n\r\nInstead, the pattern should be:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nPreAuth A: (sequence n)\r\n  Pay Account Alice 10 XLM\r\nPreAuth B: (sequence n)\r\n  Pay Account Bob 10 XLM\r\nPreAuth C: (sequence n+1)\r\n  Remove PreAuth B\r\n  Remove PreAuth A\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever in this case, we're restricted to keeping the same sequence number on A and B, which in many cases is undesirable (try A then try B).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne way of addressing this would be to have a new type of preauth which is a merkle tree of up to 4 transactions.

The simplest option is to just allow that upon successful execution of a transaction, the root is removed.\r\n\r\nThe number of branches could be increased, but that would bear increased complexity on the management of the lookup proof.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis type of mechanism makes many protocols which require mutually exclusive preauths a bit simpler to work with because the user of this API doesn't need to worry about the hash cycles between pre-auths which should remove each other.",

This can result in a pre-auth transaction failing.\r\n\r\nA solution for this is a new kind of pre-auth which bundles an amount of lumens to be made available when that transaction is executing or having fee assessed.\r\n\r\nWhen such a key is added as such H(H(PreAuth) || Fee Amount). The Fee Amount is revealed when adding the key, which is then subtracted from the account. When the preauth is being executed/fee checked in validation, that amount is added back to the account.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't fix the issue of fees increasing or changing, but makes it easier for protocol developers to ensure sufficient fees and reserves are available for their contracts to execute.\r\n\r\nSuch pre-paid fees should not be counted for the general reserves of an account, as they should not permit another transaction with insufficient fees or reserves to succeed.\r\n\r\nTo address the issue of fees changing on the network, it *might* be possible to allow a third party to 'pay into' a fee reserved preauth by revealing the preimage to H(H(preeauth) || fee amount) and then making a payment to it to be H(H(preauth) || fee + payment). This would require users to listen for such payments as they could make it difficult to execute transactions if an attacker updates the fee frequently. A cache of the last N ledgers of updated preimages (e.g., H(H(Preauth) || fee) -> H(H(preauth) || fee + payment)) which could be consulted at validation time could fix this as long as the user is aware of fee bumps at least N ledgers old.\r\n\r\n",

We should also strongly communicate the deprecation, and collect community feedback for a period of one year.\r\n\r\nAfter the one year feedback period, a policy layer (read -- the software that nominators use to select transactions, but is not enforced by validators otherwise) should block transactions with data entry modifications.\r\n\r\nThen, after an additional period, we can explore significantly increasing the reserve for Data Entries -- this enables contracts relying on Data Entries to still be processed if the person sends additional fund to the account to cover the unplanned excess.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I'd ever advocate full removal of data entries, given that a user may already have a compatibility issue, but perhaps with a long enough horizon for community input we can fully remove the feature.\r\n\r\n# Repairable Removal\r\nAlternatively, I propose that we, in the next update, fully remove data entries (transactions with that operation are invalid). If there is strong motivation for the feature in the future, I propose that we could then add back an identical feature such that those transactions would again become valid, or a new type of data entry could be added to better match the needs of users. This is semantically somewhat equivalent to dramatically increasing the minfee for a data entry operation (from the perspective of an engineer implementing a system to handle data entries).\r\n\r\n",

I have tried every browser I can find and the same errors keep happening. It doesnt matter if my device is plugged in or not...I get the same error\r\n\r\nTrezor - Connect v8 is deprecated. Please ask your DeFi platform/wallet developers (not Trezor) to update to Connect v9.\r\n\r\nLedger - TransportError: U2F browser support is needed for Ledger. Please use Chrome, Opera or Firefox with a U2F extension. Also make sure you're on an HTTPS connection\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is the right platform for help...and if it is not...My apologies...I am just worried about getting scammed on Discord.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nGeoff",

If I wish to claim payments (which are airdrops in fact) Trezor freezes at step to confirm issuer. There's no error in browser console shown at this point so I'm not sure if the issue is with Trezor or Stellarterm at this point. I tried different PCs, different browsers (including incognito mode). \r\n\r\nIs anyone experiencing similar issues?\r\n\r\nThanks and regards.",

Soon: Zcash, Radix, Solana and Cardano will be added to that list. \r\nThis is extended by 1-tx Dex aggregation to several dex’s on the EVM chains. \r\nMoreover, you can charge affiliate fees on top of the swaps to monetise the wallet.\r\n\r\nhttps://swapkit.dev\r\n\r\nWould love to hop on a meeting and tell you more about it!",

Please describe.**\r\nAs a team we are processing large sets of stellar operations by decoding the XDR packages available from the public dataset that Stellar has made available via Big Query.  Using the current XDR unpacking routines, we are seeing long processing times for large datasets.  Based on our tests we have seen the current SDK takes 100ms to perform extraction.  We have tested with 50,000,000 rows (1 year of data for one most used token on Stellar) from the BigQuery table for our extractions.  The current SDK decoding would take over 2.5 hours.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe suggest that the SDK is updated to use the Python BytesIO class for XDR decoding.  This would operates on the data completely in memory and will dramatically increase the throughput of the XDR processing task.  This change would also bring better compatability to future Python versions.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nOn some prototype code we have tested the processing time has been reduced to around 15 minutes for the same dataset.\r\n",

However, after I use the `--link` option to link the actual external contract, I still see many red HAVOC steps in the call trace. At the same time, in the \"Contracts Call Resolutions\" section, there are no longer any alerts related to unresolved calls.\n\nCould you please clarify:\n\n1. Why are there still so many HAVOC steps in the call trace after linking the external contract?\n2. In such a case, can I still trust the rule evaluation results, even when the execution trace contains many HAVOC steps?\n3. Does the presence of many HAVOC steps necessarily imply that the rule result is unreliable?\n\nAs an example, here is a link where there are no more unresolved call alerts in \"Contracts Call Resolutions\", but the call trace still shows many HAVOC steps. Is the result of this rule considered trustworthy?\n\nhttps://prover.certora.com/output/5562613/96e11c341033427fb84e48b04ecc7a61/\n\nThank you very much for your help!",

I've also set `$NODE_PATH` to point to my node_modules directory, but the compilation still fails with:\n\n```\nsolc had an error:\nParserError: Source \"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol\" not found: File not found.

Solidity 0.8.29 contract `PrizesWallet` that inherits `Ownable → Context`.\n2. CVL spec (essential parts):\n\n```cvl\nmethods {\n  function game() external returns(address) envfree;\n  function registerRoundEnd(uint256,address) external;\n  function depositEth(uint256,address) external;\n\n  // Any summary like the next line triggers an error\n  // function Context._msgSender() internal with(env e) => e.msg.sender expect address;\n}\n\nrule gameCanDepositSuccess {\n  env e; uint roundNum; address winner;\n  require game() != 0;\n  require e.msg.sender == game();\n  require winner != 0;\n\n  depositEth@withrevert(e, roundNum, winner);\n  assert !lastReverted; // should pass, but always fails\n}\n```\n\n3. Run with `certoraRun` (CLI 7.7.0, solc 0.8.29).  \n   *If the summary for `_msgSender` is **omitted**, the run finishes but the rule fails (`lastReverted` true).  \n   *If **any** summary is added, Certora terminates with compilation errors like:\n\n```\nBad internal method returns: Cannot merge \"Context._msgSender() returns (address)\" and \"Context._msgSender()\" – different arities (1 vs 0)\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nInternal method `_msgSender()` is not declared in contract PrizesWallet, although it is defined in Context. Use the defining contract instead.\n```\n\nAs a result `_msgSender` cannot be summarised and the positive path cannot be proved.\n\n---\n\n### Approaches we tried\n\n* **Wildcard summary**  \n  `function _._msgSender() internal with(env e) => e.msg.sender;`  \n  Rejected – wildcard entries cannot specify return types.\n\n* **Exact summary on defining contract**  \n  `function Context._msgSender() internal with(env e) => e.msg.sender expect address;`  \n  Fails with \"Bad internal method returns\" – Certora detects an implementation with zero return values and cannot merge signatures.\n\n* **Exact summary on inheriting contract**  \n  `function PrizesWallet._msgSender() internal with(env e) => e.msg.sender expect address;`  \n  Error: `_msgSender` not declared in `PrizesWallet` (it lives only in `Context`).\n\n* **DELETE summary then replacement summary**  \n  Removes the method entirely; all calls revert, so success path remains unverifiable.\n\n* **Hooks, ghost variables, harness contract overriding `_msgSender`**  \n  Solidity does not allow overriding non-virtual internal functions; hooks run after `_msgSender` already executed.\n\nAll attempts produce the same dead end.\n\n---\n\n### Impact\n\nWithout the ability to summarise `_msgSender`, Certora cannot prove *success* scenarios for any contract that uses OpenZeppelin's Context pattern. That blocks verification of authorised-caller flows for most modern Solidity codebases.\n\n---\n\n### Desired behaviour\n\nAllow a CVL summary for an internal function inherited from another contract without running into signature/arity merge conflicts. Ideally, an entry such as\n\n```cvl\nfunction Context._msgSender() internal with(env e) => e.msg.sender expect address;\n```\n\nshould override or coexist with the implementation detected from bytecode so that success-path rules can be proved.",

Contract calls internal library function A\n2. Library function A calls internal library function B from a different library\n\nThe error specifically occurs at the point where `RandomNumberHelpers.generateRandomNumber` calls `CryptographyHelpers.calculateHashSumOf`.\n\n### Impact\n- The verification still proceeds despite the error\n- Tests can still pass or fail based on their logic\n- However, the critical error is confusing and suggests something is fundamentally wrong\n- It's unclear if the analysis is complete or if some paths are being missed\n\n### Environment\n- Solidity version: 0.8.29\n- Certora Prover version: [Please fill in your version]\n- Command used: `certoraRun example.conf --solc solc8.29`\n\n### Additional Context\nThis issue appears to be related to how Certora's FUNCTION_BUILDER handles the inlining of nested internal library calls. The error message suggests it's expecting a different function signature than what it encounters during analysis.\n\n### Workaround\nNone found. The error doesn't prevent verification from completing, but it raises concerns about the completeness of the analysis. ",

      "body": "Hi,\nI'm trying to figure out whether it's possible to use CertoraProver's decompiler to decompile EVM bytecode without having access to the source. In particular, I've found a DecompilerTest.kt class (src/test/kotlin/decompiler/DecompilerTest.kt), which searches for JSON files in the examples directory under resources (src/test/resources/decompiler/examples).\nIt then performs the following commands to disassemble and decompiler each contract (I've introduced the variable[+] `decompiledContract`):\n\n```\nval disassembled = Disassembler.disassembleRuntimeBytecode(instance)\ntry {\n    val decompiledContract = Decompiler.decompileEVM(disassembled, instance)\n```\n\nI then try to print decompileContract to a file, but I only find TAC inside decompiledContract.fallback. Is this expected? For example, for the following contract, where I provide only the bytecode:\n\n```\npragma solidity ^0.8.10;\n\ncontract factorial {\n    uint result;\n\n    function calculateFactorial(uint256 n) public pure returns (uint256) {\n        uint f = 1;\n        for (uint i = 1; i <= n; i++) f *= i;\n        return f;\n    }\n\n    receive() external payable {\n        result = calculateFactorial(msg.value);\n    }\n}\n```\nI get the following TAC from the fallback field of the DecompiledContract object:\n```\nEVMTACProgram(code={\n0_0_0_0_0_0=[\n     AnnotationCmd   Annotation(k=block.source, v=:0)\n     AssignExpCmd L1024:bv256 0x80 (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n     AssignExpCmd L1023:bv256 0x40 (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n     MstoreCmd 0x40 0x80 tacM:bytemap (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n     AssignCallvalueCmd L1024:bv256 (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n     AssignExpCmd L1023:bv256 L1024:bv256 (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n     AssignIszeroCmd L1023:bv256 L1023:bv256 (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n     AssignExpCmd L1022:bv256 0xe (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n     JumpiCmd 14_1024_0_0_2_0 11_1024_0_0_0_0 L1023:bv256 (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n]\n14_1024_0_0_2_0=[\n     JumpdestCmd 14_1024_0_0_2_0\n     AnnotationCmd   Annotation(k=block.source, v=:14)\n     NopCmd\n     AssignExpCmd L1024:bv256 0x228 (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n     AssignExpCmd L1023:bv256 0x228 (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n     AssignExpCmd L1022:bv256 0x1c (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n     AssignExpCmd L1021:bv256 0x0 (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n     CodecopyCmd L1021:bv256 L1022:bv256 L1023:bv256 tacM:bytemap tacCodedata (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n     AssignExpCmd L1023:bv256 0x0 (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n     EVMReturnCmd L1023:bv256 L1024:bv256 tacM:bytemap (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n]\n11_1024_0_0_0_0=[\n    AnnotationCmd   Annotation(k=block.source, v=:11)\n    AssignExpCmd L1023:bv256 0x0 (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n    AssignExpCmd L1022:bv256 0x0 (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n    EVMRevertCmd L1022:bv256 L1023:bv256 BENIGN tacM:bytemap (0:0:-1:0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488d)\n]\n},\nblockgraph={0_0_0_0_0_0=[11_1024_0_0_0_0, 14_1024_0_0_2_0], 14_1024_0_0_2_0=[], 11_1024_0_0_0_0=[]},\nname=-fallback,\nsymbolTable=TACSymbolTable(userDefinedTypes=[],\nuninterpretedFunctions={},\ntags=Tags(tagged=[L1021:bv256, L1022:bv256, L1023:bv256, L1024:bv256, tacM:bytemap], overrides={}), globalScope={}), entryBlock=null)\n```\nIs this the correct use of the decompiled contract to get the TAC?

It may be worth requesting a change to the stellar-core repo to add an option that outputs just the supported protocol version (e.g., `stellar-core version --protocol` or similar).\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\n1. **Status quo**: Continue requiring `config.protocol_version_default` to be explicitly set for every image in `images.json`. This works but adds maintenance overhead and risk of the configuration going out of date.\n\n2. **Fail gracefully with a clear error**: Instead of failing with confusing errors, detect the missing configuration and provide a helpful error message telling users to set `--protocol-version` explicitly.",

When testing against the public test network the easiest path to access is to approach is to communicate directly with the SDF hosted testnet RPC at https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org or the SDF hosted testnet Horizon at https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org. The quickstart image only adds value to setup when running a local network.\n\nToday the image when started without any other parameters defaults connecting to testnet. This means for the default common case a developer needs to read the docs and pass additional parameters.\n\nThe stellar-cli has a `stellar container start` command that defaults already to starting the container in local mode for the same reason.\n\nImpact:\n\nFor anyone using this image without parameters to connect to testnet, they will see the container instead connect to local and will need to add a parameter `--testnet`.\n\ncc @stellar/devx @janewang ",

The fuzz crate at `tests/fuzz/fuzz/` has its own `Cargo.lock` file (separate from the workspace) and depends on `soroban-sdk` via a path dependency. When versions are bumped using `cargo set-version`, only the root `Cargo.lock` is updated - the nested fuzz lock file still references the old version, causing a mismatch.\n\nWe've been manually updating the fuzz lock file during releases, but this is error-prone. For example, this was accidentally missed during the v23.4.1 release (https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/pull/1681). The release process shouldn't require manual steps.\n\nThe fix requires adding a step to the bump-version workflow that runs `cargo update --manifest-path tests/fuzz/fuzz/Cargo.toml soroban-sdk` to conservatively update only the `soroban-sdk` entry in the fuzz lock file.",

Another example I might consider on my side is to force to have strictly 2 admins for some 4 eyes principal validations.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nI would like to be able to use a construction like `VecN<3>`.

Developers must use `Vec<T>` for sequences, losing compile-time size guarantees.\n\nThis was discussed in Discord: https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1398600170199056424/1399530234713215041\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nSupport for `[T; N]` as contract function parameter and return types, where `T` is any supported type except `u8` (since `[u8; N]` is already covered by `BytesN<N>`).\n\nExample:\n```rust\n#[contractimpl]\nimpl MyContract {\n    pub fn process_fixed_array(env: Env, data: [u32; 4]) -> [u64; 2] {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\n1. **Use `Vec<T>`** - Already works, but loses compile-time size guarantees\n2. **Use tuples** - `(T, T, T, T)` works for small fixed sizes but is verbose and limited to 12 elements\n\n### Concerns\n\nThe utility of this feature may not justify the implementation complexity.\n\nKey concerns:\n\n1. **Requires new XDR spec type** - There's no `ScSpecTypeArray` in stellar-xdr. A new spec type would need to be added, otherwise contracts defined with `#[contractimpl]` wouldn't have a matching interface when imported via `#[contractimport]`. This requires changes to stellar-xdr and the broader ecosystem.\n\n2. **No Rust specialization** - Without specialization, we cannot provide different implementations for `[u8; N]` vs `[T; N]` where `T != u8`. This means `[u8; N]` would have to be an error case with folks needing to use `BytesN`.",

This hinders the developers to write additional math libraries that may require the `checked` versions.\n\nIn our case, we are writing a fixed_point_math library, and a `WAD` equivalent for Soroban. However, especially the error-handling part becomes a bit inconsistent due to lack of `checked` variants.\n\nHere is a code piece:\n\n```rust\npub(crate) fn checked_mul_div_floor(env: &Env, x: &I256, y: &I256, z: &I256) -> Option<I256> {\n    let zero = I256::from_i32(env, 0);\n    let r = x.mul(y);\n\n    // we handle `DivisionByZero` case, and return `None` as expected by the `checked` variant\n    if *z == zero {\n        return None;\n    }\n\n    if (r < zero && *z > zero) || (r > zero && *z < zero) {\n        // ceil is taken by default for a negative result\n\n        // if `rem_euclid` fails, this will panic, but it should have returned `None` instead...\n        let remainder = r.rem_euclid(z);\n        let one = I256::from_i32(env, 1);\n\n        // similarly, if `div` or `sub` fails, this will panic, but it should have returned `None` instead...\n        Some(r.div(z).sub(if remainder > zero { &one } else { &zero }))\n    } else {\n        // floor is taken by default for a positive or zero result\n        Some(r.div(z))\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### What would you like to see?\n`checked` variants of all the arithmetic functions\n\n### What alternatives are there?\nI saw that, behind the scenes, `env.i256_{operation}` is used. For example:\n\n```rust\n    pub fn mul(&self, other: &I256) -> I256 {\n        let val = self.env.i256_mul(self.val, other.val).unwrap_infallible();\n        I256 {\n            env: self.env.clone(),\n            val,\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nHowever, it is quite unintuitive, and even impossible to use the underlying `i256_{operation}` functions as alternative. \n\nImpossible, due to:\n- these functions are private, not public\n\nUnintuitive, due to:\n- we have to import `i256Val` type\n- it is returning `Result`, and we have to map the `Result` into `Option`\n- it is not named as `checked`, which creates confusion\n- the required argument type `I256Val`, is reachable only through `self.to_val_type()`, which adds additional friction\n\n\n\n",

Today in tests we provide functions for viewing events, auths, and other data—developers typically use `std::println!` to print them out and inspect them manually.\n\nThe `tracing` crate is a widely-used tracing library in the Rust ecosystem. Many crates already use it, which means in a complex application where dependencies are using tracing, developers can set the `RUST_LOG` env var to filter sub-systems and log levels (e.g., `RUST_LOG=soroban_env_host=debug,my_contract=trace`).\n\nGiving developers the ability to set an env var when running tests to output all the events as they happen would provide an idiomatic Rust experience, rather than requiring manual println calls and custom inspection code. This would give developers greater visibility into what is happening without us having to build as many custom APIs to achieve the same visibility.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nAdd `tracing` crate integration to:\n- `soroban-sdk` (when `testutils` feature is enabled)\n- Generated code from SDK macros\n- `soroban-env-host` (when `testutils` feature is enabled)\n\nAt minimum, the host should be updated to use the tracing crate for:\n- Diagnostic events\n- Contract events  \n- Host function calls\n\nThis would involve adding the `tracing` crate as a dependency (behind `testutils` feature flag) and adding trace/debug/info spans and events throughout key code paths.\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\n**Do nothing / wait for on-chain visibility solution:** At some point, the issue of greater visibility will likely be solved for on-chain execution, and that solution might be usable in tests too—which could make tracing crate usage redundant. However, if tracing serves as a stop-gap for a year or two while the on-chain solution is developed, that seems worthwhile.\n\n**Build custom debugging APIs:** We could continue building bespoke debugging APIs, but this requires more effort and doesn't integrate with the broader Rust ecosystem's debugging workflows.\n\ncc @mootz12 ",

      "body": "When importing a contract into another contract, the exported functions of the dependency become included in the final artifact. This isn't new, we've observed this behaviour since the early days of building Soroban contracts.\n\nAs far as we are aware this is a symptom of how rustc works, and have seen the behaviour discussed in places such as:\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/104707\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73958\n\nThis can result in the functions of a dependency intentionally or unintentionally polluting the final artifact. Developers can use this behaviour to implement shared functions in one library and import them into one or more contracts. The developers docs don't actively advertise this behaviour because it's surprising and somewhat odd, and to the best of my knowledge there is no use of this today to actively do contract function sharing.\n\nIf a dependency exports a function that overlaps with the crate it is being imported into, then Rustc will error, but only if LTO is enabled. If LTO is disabled, the build will succeed and it is unclear to me if there are specific rules about which function would be the function found in the final binary in that case. I suspect any observable behaviour could be UB.\n\nGiven how easy it is to accidentally export functions from another contract in a multi-contract workspace, or the possibility that a dependence imported could export a function as a form of code injection, I think it's worth looking for ways to prevent symbols from dependencies making it into the final build as exported.\n\nThoughts @graydon @brson ?",

The way we have addressed the need for historical state today in the Soroban Rust SDK and stellar-cli's snapshot testing is for the stellar-cli to download a history archive, which takes considerable effort to identify ahead of time the appropriate footprint. It also requires significant bandwidth.\n\nThis issue is to explore improving the fork testing experience by having the SDK act independently to retrieve ledger entries from data sources as it needs them, build a local footprint snapshot that can still be committed and used for subsequent runs, but where the footprint does not need to be known ahead of the first run.\n\nThe solution should have some properties:\n- Reduced bandwidth for the common cases (the solution today requires a full archive to be downloaded).\n- Not require the user to navigate footprints on their own (the solution today requires a user to identify a superset of their footprint).\n\nThe way the SDK fork testing works today is:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    user->>+cli: create snapshot with<br/>accountIDs and contract IDs\n    cli->>+historyarchive: req full ledger\n    historyarchive->>-cli: full ledger (GBs, slow)\n    cli->>cli: filter ledger down to<br/>accountIDs and contract IDs<br/>(painful dev experience)\n    cli->>-user: snapshot (KBs)\n    \n    user->>+sdk: write test importing snapshot for fork testing\n    sdk->>sdk: loads snapshot and uses it as storage starting point\n    sdk->>-user: \n```\n\nAt a high level the way it should work:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    user->>+sdk: write test fork testing ledger N\n    loop \n    sdk->>sdk: test running\n    alt local snapshot exists (cache)\n    sdk->>sdk: load ledger entry for key K from snapshot\n    else local snapshot does not exist\n    sdk->>+datasource: req ledger entry for key K ledger N\n    datasource->>-sdk: entry for K (Bytes)\n    end\n    end\n    opt if new entries were downloaded\n    sdk->>sdk: write local snapshot for starting point\n    end\n    sdk->>-user: \n```\n\nThis idea was first discussed here:\n- https://github.com/stellar/quickstart/issues/625#issuecomment-2686362940\n\nThis issue should orient around two user stories:\n\n1. Debugging a specific transaction – A developer wishes to write tests or debug behaviour before or after a specific transaction. Importantly this means state needs to be accessibly granular down to the level of a tx itself, not a ledger.\n\n2. Testing against any arbitrary recent state – A developer wishes to write a test with mainnet data, but no specific point is particularly important.\n\nThe solutions for these two use cases could be different.",

We cannot verify which function required the authorization or with what parameters.\n\n\n\nReference: [Original discussion](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/pull/84#discussion_r1982898618)\n",

Thanks! -->\n### What problem does your feature solve?\nAuthentication mistakes in smart contracts.\n\n### What would you like to see?\nCurrently, to require signature from address, developers of smart contracts have to call `address.require_auth()` or require authorization for specific function arguments. I think it's quite easy to forget or make mistake about it in more complex scenarios, where more signatures are required, etc. My request or rather question is would it be worth it to enforce it at type level. So for example something like this:\n\n```rust\n// plain address argument, does not require authorization\nstruct Address { ... };\n// address that has provided a signature\n// having it in function signature would be equivalent to current flow:\n// address: Address into address.require_auth();\nstruct SignedAddress { ... };\n// for more granular control.\nstruct SignedArg/GuardedArg<T> { value: T, signers: Vec<Address> }\n```\n\nAbove examples are just to illustrate proposition.\nI am quite new to the stellar/soroban so I may have misunderstood something :| but overall I think it would be quite nice to have these assertions done at the type level and enforced by protocol.\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\nThe alternative is to keep things as they are.\n",

The behaviour will be visible after https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/pull/1620 merges._\n\n### What did you do?\n\nWhen registering a native test contract with `Env::register()`, the Host requests entries from the `SnapshotSource`, including a `ContractCode` entry with the empty WASM hash (`e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855` - the SHA256 of zero bytes).\n\nThis can be observed by implementing a custom `SnapshotSource` that logs all `get` requests:\n\n```rust\nstruct LoggingSnapshotSource;\n\nimpl SnapshotSource for LoggingSnapshotSource {\n    fn get(&self, key: &Rc) -> Result<Option<(Rc, Option)>, HostError> {\n        eprintln!(\"Attempted to get ledger key: {:?}\", key);\n        Ok(None)\n    }\n}\n\n#[test]\nfn test() {\n    let e = Env::from_ledger_snapshot(LoggingSnapshotSource);\n    let contract_id = e.register(Contract, ());\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nAttempted to get ledger key: ContractCode(LedgerKeyContractCode { hash: Hash(e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855) })\nAttempted to get ledger key: ContractData(LedgerKeyContractData { contract: Contract(...), key: LedgerKeyContractInstance, durability: Persistent })\n```\n\nAdditionally, the empty WASM hash entry appears in test snapshot JSON files written to disk:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"contract_code\": {\n    \"hash\": \"e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### What did you expect to see?\n\nThe empty WASM hash is an implementation detail for native test contracts. It should be:\n1. **Filtered from `SnapshotSource` requests** - The SDK should intercept requests for the empty WASM hash and return `None` without forwarding to the underlying source\n2. **Excluded from ledger snapshots** - The empty WASM code entry should not appear in snapshot JSON files written to disk\n\n### What did you see instead?\n\nThe empty WASM hash leaks through both interfaces:\n- Custom `SnapshotSource` implementations receive requests for it\n- Test snapshot files contain the empty WASM entry\n\n## Why This Is Problematic\n\nThe `SnapshotSource` trait enables powerful use cases like loading ledger state from external sources - RPC endpoints, network archives, or other remote data stores. These sources may involve:\n\n- **Network requests** that add latency\n- **Rate-limited APIs** where each request counts\n- **Expensive lookups** across distributed systems\n\nWhen the Host requests the empty WASM hash from a `SnapshotSource`, it forces these implementations to make a request for an entry that **will never exist** on any real network. This is a waste of resources and adds unnecessary latency to test setup.\n\nThe empty WASM hash is purely an internal implementation detail of how the Host and SDK handle native test contracts. Contract developers implementing custom `SnapshotSource`s should not need to know about or handle this edge case - it should be invisible to them.\n\nSimilarly, the empty WASM entry appearing in snapshot JSON files is confusing noise. These files may be checked into source control, shared between teams, or used for debugging. The empty WASM entry adds clutter and raises questions about what it is and why it exists.\n\n## Current vs Proposed Behavior\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Test\n    participant SDK as Soroban SDK\n    participant Host as Soroban Host\n    participant Wrapper as FilteringSnapshotSource<br/>(NEW)\n    participant SS as SnapshotSource\n    participant Net as Network/RPC\n\n    Test->>SDK: Env::from_ledger_snapshot(source)\n\n    rect rgba(0, 200, 0, 0.15)\n        Note right of SDK: ✅ NEW\n        SDK->>SDK: Wrap source in FilteringSnapshotSource\n    end\n\n    SDK->>Host: Create Host with source\n    Test->>SDK: env.register(Contract, ())\n    SDK->>Host: Register native contract\n\n    Note over Host,Net: Host requests empty WASM hash...\n\n    alt OLD BEHAVIOR (being removed)\n        rect rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.15)\n            Note right of Host: ❌ REMOVED\n            Host->>SS: get(ContractCode{hash: empty})\n            SS->>Net: Request empty WASM (wasteful!)\n            Net-->>SS: Not found\n            SS-->>Host: None\n        end\n    else NEW BEHAVIOR (being added)\n        rect rgba(0, 200, 0, 0.15)\n            Note right of Host: ✅ NEW\n            Host->>Wrapper: get(ContractCode{hash: empty})\n            Wrapper-->>Host: None (intercepted, not forwarded)\n        end\n    end\n\n    alt OLD BEHAVIOR (being removed)\n        rect rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.15)\n            Host->>SS: get(ContractData{instance})\n            SS->>Net: Request contract instance\n            Net-->>SS: Entry or not found\n            SS-->>Host: Result\n        end\n    else NEW BEHAVIOR (being added)\n        rect rgba(0, 200, 0, 0.15)\n            Host->>Wrapper: get(ContractData{instance})\n            Wrapper->>SS: get(ContractData{instance})\n            SS->>Net: Request contract instance\n            Net-->>SS: Entry or not found\n            SS-->>Wrapper: Result\n            Wrapper-->>Host: Result\n        end\n    end\n\n    Note over Test,Net: Later, when saving snapshot...\n\n    Test->>SDK: env.to_ledger_snapshot()\n    SDK->>Host: get_stored_entries()\n    Host-->>SDK: All entries including empty WASM\n\n    alt OLD BEHAVIOR (being removed)\n        rect rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.15)\n            Note right of SDK: ❌ REMOVED\n            SDK-->>Test: LedgerSnapshot WITH empty WASM entry\n        end\n    else NEW BEHAVIOR (being added)\n        rect rgba(0, 200, 0, 0.15)\n            Note right of SDK: ✅ NEW\n            SDK->>SDK: Filter out empty WASM entry\n            SDK-->>Test: LedgerSnapshot WITHOUT empty WASM entry\n        end\n    end\n```\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. **Wrap the `SnapshotSource`**: In `Env::new_for_testutils`, wrap the provided `SnapshotSource` in a filtering wrapper that intercepts requests for `ContractCode` entries with the empty WASM hash and returns `None` immediately without forwarding to the underlying source.\n\n2. **Filter `to_ledger_snapshot()` output**: When generating a `LedgerSnapshot` via `to_ledger_snapshot()`, filter out entries with the empty WASM hash before returning.\n\n## Why not fix this in the Host?\n\nThe Host exposes its raw storage to the SDK via `get_stored_entries()`. Even if the Host handled the `SnapshotSource` side internally, the SDK would still need to filter the entries when generating snapshots. Handling both in the SDK keeps the solution contained in one place.\n\nIt would be possible to fix this entirely in the Host, but it would require either not exposing the full storage to the SDK or changing how storage is exposed to the SDK. While doable, this would increase the amount of specialized test code in the Host, which is also not desirable.",

      "body": "When folks implement their contracts, they specify their types and there's an assumption that callers will always pass the correct types.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the following contract function a single parameter is expected to be a `u32`:\r\n```rust\r\n#[contractimpl]\r\nimpl Contract {\r\n    pub fn doit(thing: u32) {\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndeed the tooling does a lot to make sure that clients do indeed pass a u32. Generated clients for Rust contracts expose typed calling functions that will only accept and send a u32. Generated bindings for TypeScript dapps expose typed functions. Even the Soroban CLI knows what types are required on the command line because it interrogates the contract interface (spec) to know what is required.\r\n\r\nHowever, its also possible for contracts to call other contracts directly, ignoring any well defined interface. Anyone implementing the custom account interface will need to unpack their signature and that's not something currently captured and generated into bindings. There are also cases where conversion occurs reading things from storage and human error results in the wrong type being expected.\r\n\r\nSome of those cases will be improved over time, but there's always going to be cases where a type is expected, the wrong type of value is provided, and an error occurs.\r\n\r\nToday that error looks like this:\r\n```\r\nVM call trapped: UnreachableCodeReached\r\n```\r\nRef: https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1225612987381841993/1225652824252354602\r\n\r\nThe error isn't specific or useful. When a function has a few parameters, and does a few conversions within, it can be difficult to know or debug where the problem has occurred.\r\n\r\nWe've talked about this a few times in different forums, but we need conversion failure to generate some sort of diagnostic log that indicates, attempt to convert to X, but got Y which doesn't convert. For contract function parameters too we also have the opportunity to add an additional log that states the function being called, as well as which number parameter it is that failed to convert.",

      "body": "### What problem does your feature solve?\n\nThis started as a Twitter conversation after Tomer's request for feedback. Thanks again for the outreach 🙇 \n\nhttps://x.com/PamphileRoy/status/1848414906070278633\n\nAs the ecosystem grows, more and more small contracts will be created. Leveraging these contract will enable people to build faster, in a modular way and with confidence.\n\nA few pieces are missing to make this a smooth process. Error handling is one thing (already being discussed [there](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-env/issues/1458)) and here I would like to focus on the dependency management itself.\n\nFor context, I am building Tansu.dev and I am depending on Soroban Domains. Everything is public if that helps:\n\nhttps://github.com/tupui/soroban-versioning/tree/main/contracts\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nChristmas list on top of my head 😄 \n\n- Trust indication: it would be handy to have a way to link contracts to audits, reputation, etc. on-chain verification would be a natural plus. A simpler alternative is to make a trusted registry (here I am not sure if there is a concept of channel or registry in Rust, I guess so.) The OpenZepplin discussion goes along that way I think.\n- Dependency definition: ideally I think using the cargo.toml for that would be natural. Behind the scene it would be great if it could basically download the wasm for us, or the source and compile it as any other dependency. i.e. replace \n  ```rust\n  mod domain_contract {\n      soroban_sdk::contractimport!(\n          file = \"../domain_3ebbeec072f4996958d4318656186732773ab5f0c159dcf039be202b4ecb8af8.wasm\"\n      );\n  }\n  ``` \n  with a simple `use other_contract::stuff`.\n  I think once we have something like this, we should add tools for Explorers to show you the list of dependent/dependencies of a specific contracts. Might be very simple if people already use the contract verification feature and I could see this workflow just sending the toml file. Of course we can also think about adding more metadata to contracts (and here linking to the initiative we are [discussing](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1213642853339766805/1293795340515934230) about a metadata standard for Soroban Domains which can be used to add metadata to a contract.)\n- Testing and contract initialisation: that part might be harder. Right now if you want to depend on another contract, you need to deep dive into their test suite and figure out what you need to do on your side to make your own testing work. That's a lot of work. I am thinking that we could either have a mocking mechanism, or define a standard for projects to spin up their contracts easily. I think the initiative around the `init/initialize` standard method would go along that direction. What would be missing is providing a sort of minimal template to spin up the contract and have it functional. (I am also thinking about [SorobanHub](https://sorobanhub.com) here and if we had such standard, SorobanHub could use it to directly populate some widgets)\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\nSolutions like [Trustful](https://trustful-stellar.vercel.app) (providing badges) or [Tansu](https://tansu.dev) (soon to integrate Trustful and on-chain help to validate code and maintainers) are eventually going to help by providing a way to keep contracts and maintainers in check. But that only contribute to securing the supply chain, not improve the DX.\n",

Thanks! -->\r\n\r\n### What problem does your feature solve?\r\n\r\nInvariants are statements that can be made about a program that should always be true. All programs have invariants, and contracts being largely state machines, it is very achievable for contract developers to write statements for their programs that certain things are always true.\r\n\r\n### What would you like to see?\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the SDK provide a standard way to write invariants for a contract, so that the invariants could be automatically used in a variety of ways to detect unexpected behavior:\r\n- Use in standard test runs, by running the invariants after every invocation (not just after every test) to ensure that the contract state didn't end up in a state that is invalid.\r\n- Use in fuzz tests.\r\n- Potentially in the future as something that can be exported and used in monitoring of on chain contracts.\r\n- Potentially in the future as something that can be exported and used for validating the affects of upcoming protocol changes.\r\n\r\n### What alternatives are there?\r\n\r\nIt could be argued that some invariants can be written as efficient assertions, and as such the infrastructure for invariants isn't necessary since assertions can be littered throughout the program code gaining the benefit that it is running on chain too. However, invariants can be more powerful than assertions because an invariant might operate on all state that a contract has, which an assertion in the standard program execution would never have access to.\r\n\r\nFuzz tests typically contain invariants, and people already write fuzz tests for Soroban contracts, so it could be argued we don't need new infrastructure/features for invariants, but I think the potential for wider use of invariants in most places makes this valuable.",

We've made it somewhat easy by prefilling related data for developers, so when they ask for a contract, we prefill all its data and its code. But it could be much easier if in a developer could write one line, with a network name and a ledger sequence, and for the SDK to build the snapshot as required by the test itself.\r\n\r\n### What would you like to see?\r\n\r\nA new function added to `Env`, `Env::from_history_archive(\"testnet\", 12798787)` that creates an Env that first downloads the buckets for that ledger from history archives.\r\n\r\nIt is also setup with a storage snapshot implementation that searches the bucket files for the ledger entries as they are requested, and does two levels of caching.\r\n\r\nFirst it caches keys to entries by storing the entry in a file with name defined by a hash of the network, ledger seq, and key so that entries can be looked up fast by other tests that access the same entry. Second at the end of the test it writes out a ledger snapshot file containing all the entries that were read during the test with the values at the first read (just like the file that `stellar snapshot create `makes).\r\n\r\n### What alternatives are there?\r\n\r\nStick with `stellar snapshot create`.\r\n",

My thoughts on this from [here](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-env/issues/635#issuecomment-1400982341) are quoted below - \r\n\r\n> I have been thinking about if there are any admin methods in the interface that should be pulled out because they're specific to Stellar assets and can be implemented as an extension to the interface (clawback() is a good example of this). I can see the argument for removing set_admin as well since administrative type methods are typically used as one-off calls (and are more likely to require custom logic/function signature). Custom tokens shouldn't have to implement methods that they don't need either. The [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) interface is actually quite bare, which makes it easier to implement tokens.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscord thread with a discussion about this [here](https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1067184117533384704/1067184117533384704).\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "### What problem does your feature solve?\r\n\r\nRight now we have direct support for fuzz testing via cargo-fuzz and proptesting via proptest-arbitrary-interop. This support mainly consists of implementations of [`Arbitrary`](https://docs.rs/arbitrary), the trait required by cargo-fuzz, for Soroban types. proptest-arbitrary-interop can be used to convert between these implementations and the traits required by proptest.\r\n\r\nThere are two main problems with this arrangement:\r\n\r\n1) The cargo-fuzz UX is poor - fuzz tests are their own programs, the code doesn't look like or live next to unit tests, and the test runner output is unsophisticated. I believe the test runner output is built into libfuzzer, which receives no updates, and not under the control of cargo-fuzz.\r\n2) The proptests enabled by this scheme are limited - proptest allows for many \"strategies\" for creating and minimizing test inputs, but this scheme only allows for random number inputs that can't sensibly be minimized. cc https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues/1105\r\n\r\n### What would you like to see?\r\n\r\nIt may be worth implementing direct support for the `proptest` crate, which would entail implementing different traits for Soroban types, and again might require a complex prototype/builder pattern to construct those types into Soroban `Env`s.\r\n\r\nThis would increase the maintenance requirements for the SDK, and make the fuzz/prop testing story more complex. I do find `proptest` quite complicated, needing to read significant amounts of the proptest book to understand how to use it.\r\n\r\n### What alternatives are there?\r\n\r\nInstead of proptests, https://github.com/loiclec/fuzzcheck-rs is a fuzzing engine that allows fuzz tests to be written more like Rust unit tests, inline with other code. Similar experience with a different testing strategy. Less mature than proptest. This also requires supporting different traits than the existing `Arbitrary`.\r\n\r\nThe quickcheck crate is similar and may be less complex to understand than the proptest crate.\r\n\r\n",

However, it lacks the ability to filter by accounts involved in the transaction or the fee payer.\n\n## Problems\n\n1. **No fee payer filtering** - Cannot filter transactions by who paid for them\n2. **No account filtering** - Cannot filter by specific accounts involved (signers, token accounts, etc.)\n3. **Limited expression parameters** - Only `signature`, `slot`, `fee`, `is_success` are available; no account-related fields\n\nThis limits monitoring use cases such as:\n- Monitoring program interactions only when initiated by a specific wallet\n- Filtering transactions where a particular account is the fee payer\n- Matching only when specific token accounts are involved\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. **Extend `build_transaction_params()`** in [filter.rs:169-199](src/services/filter/filters/solana/filter.rs#L169-L199) to include:\n   - `fee_payer` - First account in `account_keys` (Solana convention)\n   - `accounts` - All accounts involved in the transaction\n\n2. **Add account-based filtering** as an alternative to log-based filtering (program ID matching remains required)\n\n3. **Example expressions to support:**\n   ```\n   fee_payer == \"WaLLeT123...\"\n   accounts contains \"TokenAccount456...\"\n   ```\n\n## Trade-offs to Consider\n\n- **Performance**: Checking all accounts increases matching complexity vs program-ID-only filtering\n- **Configuration complexity**: Need to decide if accounts filter in `addresses` array or via expressions only\n- **Consistency with EVM**: EVM uses `from`/`to` which maps cleanly to sender/recipient; Solana has N accounts per transaction with different roles\n\n## Related Code\n\n- Solana filter: [src/services/filter/filters/solana/filter.rs](src/services/filter/filters/solana/filter.rs)\n- EVM filter (reference): [src/services/filter/filters/evm/filter.rs](src/services/filter/filters/evm/filter.rs)\n- Solana transaction model: [src/models/blockchain/solana/transaction.rs](src/models/blockchain/solana/transaction.rs)\n- Monitor config model: [src/models/core/monitor.rs](src/models/core/monitor.rs)\n",

Custom network names (e.g., `\"my-solana-rpc\"`) would fail detection.\n\n2. **Mixed network types**: If a monitor tracks multiple networks of different types, this logic assumes they're all the same type (Solana or non-Solana).\n\n3. **False positives/negatives**: A network named `\"solana_like_evm\"` would be incorrectly treated as Solana.\n\n#### Proposed Solution\n\nConsider one of the following approaches:\n\n1. **Look up actual `BlockChainType` from network configuration**: Instead of relying on string matching, query the network configuration to get the actual blockchain type. This would require access to network configs during validation.\n\n2. **Move signature validation to repository level**: Shift the signature check to `validate_monitor_references` where network configurations are already available, allowing proper type-based validation.\n\n#### Trade-offs to Consider\n\n- Adding network config lookup to the `validate` method increases coupling and complexity\n- Moving validation to repository level changes the validation architecture\n- The current approach works for standard configurations but may break with custom network names\n\n#### Related Code\n\n- `src/models/config/monitor_config.rs` - lines 175-204 (signature validation logic)\n- Repository-level validation in `validate_monitor_references`",

This can lead to missed notifications in cases of temporary failures like network issues or rate limiting.\n\n## Current Behavior\nLooking at the notification services in `src/services/notification/`, notifications fail immediately on any error without retry attempts. This is less resilient compared to our RPC endpoint management system which has sophisticated retry and rotation mechanisms.\n\n## Proposed Solution\nImplement a retry mechanism for notifications similar to the RPC endpoint management system, with the following components:\n\n1. **Retry Policy Configuration**\n   - Configurable number of retry attempts\n   - Exponential backoff strategy\n   - Configurable retry conditions (e.g., network errors, rate limits)\n\n2. **Notification Manager**\n   - Similar to `EndpointManager` but for notifications\n   - Handles retry logic and backoff\n   - Manages notification-specific error handling\n\n3. **Retry Strategy**\n   - Define which errors are retryable\n   - Handle rate limiting specifically\n   - Log retry attempts and failures\n\n\n### Retryable Error Types (Example)\n```rust\npub enum NotificationError {\n    RateLimitError { retry_after: Duration },\n    NetworkError,\n    TemporaryError,\n    PermanentError,\n}\n\nfn is_retryable_error(error: &NotificationError) -> bool {\n    matches!(error, \n        NotificationError::RateLimitError { .. } |\n        NotificationError::NetworkError |\n        NotificationError::TemporaryError\n    )\n}\n```\n\n## Integration Points\n\n1. **Existing Notification Services**\n   - Slack (`slack.rs`)\n   - Discord (`discord.rs`)\n   - Email (`email.rs`)\n   - Webhook (`webhook.rs`)\n   - Telegram (`telegram.rs`)\n   - Script (`script.rs`)\n\n2. **Error Handling**\n   - Update `error.rs` to include retry-specific error types\n   - Add retry-related logging\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Implement `NotificationManager` with retry logic\n- [ ] Add configuration for retry attempts and backoff strategy\n- [ ] Implement retryable error types and detection\n- [ ] Add retry support for all notification services\n- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for retry attempts\n- [ ] Add metrics for notification success/failure rates\n- [ ] Add documentation for retry behavior\n- [ ] Add tests covering retry scenarios\n\n## References\n- Current RPC retry implementation in `endpoint_manager.rs`\n- Current notification services in `src/services/notification/`\n\n## Additional Considerations\n- Consider implementing different retry strategies for different notification types\n- Consider adding circuit breaker pattern for failing notification services\n- Consider implementing notification queuing for high-load scenarios",

Convert message to bytes (UTF-8 if string)\n2. Prepend the fixed prefix: `\"Stellar Signed Message:\\n\"`\n3. Compute `hash = SHA256(prefix + message)`\n4. Sign `hash` with ed25519 private key\n5. Return 64-byte signature\n\n### Suggested Implementation\n\nIn `src/keypair.js`:\n\n```javascript\nconst MESSAGE_PREFIX = Buffer.from('Stellar Signed Message:\\n');\n\n/**\n * Sign an arbitrary message according to SEP-53.\n * @param {string|Buffer} message - The message to sign\n * @returns {Buffer} 64-byte ed25519 signature\n * @see https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0053.md\n */\nsignMessage(message) {\n  if (!this.canSign()) {\n    throw new Error('Cannot sign: no secret key available');\n  }\n  const messageHash = this._calculateMessageHash(message);\n  return this.sign(messageHash);\n}\n\n/**\n * Verify a SEP-53 signed message.\n * @param {string|Buffer} message - The original message\n * @param {Buffer} signature - The signature to verify\n * @returns {boolean} True if signature is valid\n */\nverifyMessage(message, signature) {\n  const messageHash = this._calculateMessageHash(message);\n  return this.verify(messageHash, signature);\n}\n\n/**\n * Calculate the SEP-53 message hash.\n * @private\n */\n_calculateMessageHash(message) {\n  const messageBytes = typeof message === 'string' \n    ? Buffer.from(message, 'utf8') \n    : Buffer.from(message);\n  const payload = Buffer.concat([MESSAGE_PREFIX, messageBytes]);\n  return hash(payload); // Uses existing hash function (SHA-256)\n}\n```\n\n## Test Vectors\n\nSEP-53 provides test vectors that should be used for validation:\n\n| Message | Expected Signature (base64) |\n|---------|----------------------------|\n| `Hello, World!` | `fO5dbYhXUhBMhe6kId/cuVq/AfEnHRHEvsP8vXh03M1uLpi5e46yO2Q8rEBzu3feXQewcQE5GArp88u6ePK6BA==` |\n| `こんにちは、世界！` | `CDU265Xs8y3OWbB/56H9jPgUss5G9A0qFuTqH2zs2YDgTm+++dIfmAEceFqB7bhfN3am59lCtDXrCtwH2k1GBA==` |\n\n(Using public key `GBXFXNDLV4LSWA4VB7YIL5GBD7BVNR22SGBTDKMO2SBZZHDXSKZYCP7L`)\n\n## TypeScript Types\n\n```typescript\ndeclare class Keypair {\n  // ... existing methods ...\n  \n  /**\n   * Sign an arbitrary message according to SEP-53.\n   * @param message - The message to sign (string or Buffer)\n   * @returns 64-byte signature as Buffer\n   * @throws Error if keypair cannot sign (no secret key)\n   */\n  signMessage(message: string | Buffer): Buffer;\n  \n  /**\n   * Verify a SEP-53 signed message.\n   * @param message - The original message\n   * @param signature - The signature to verify\n   * @returns true if valid, false otherwise\n   */\n  verifyMessage(message: string | Buffer, signature: Buffer): boolean;\n}\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [SEP-53 Specification](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0053.md)\n- [Python SDK Implementation (PR #1067)](https://github.com/StellarCN/py-stellar-base/pull/1067)\n- [Java SDK Implementation (PR #698)](https://github.com/lightsail-network/java-stellar-sdk/pull/698)\n- [Freighter Wallet signMessage API](https://docs.freighter.app/docs/playground/signmessage/)",

There are also multiple ways to do the same thing.\n\nFor example there are three ways to get at / work with number values:\n\n1. Use the `scValToBigInt` function:\n   ```js\n   // ScVal -> BigInt\n   const bigint = scValToBigInt(scval);\n   ```\n\n2. Use the `ScInt` type:\n   ```js\n   // ScVal -> BigInt\n   const bigint = ScInt.fromScVal(scval);\n   ```\n   ```js\n   // BigInt -> ScVal\n   const scval = new ScInt(bigint).toI128();\n   ```\n\n   _Another problem with `ScInt` is that it looks like an XDR type, but it isn't._\n\n3. Use the `XdrLargeInt` type. This type should probably not be exported as it seems like an implementation detail?\n\n   ```js\n   // ScVal -> BigInt\n   const bigint = new XdrLargeInt(scIntType, [scval.value().lo(), scval.value().hi()]).toBigInt();\n   ```\n\n   _Another problem with `XdrLargeInt` is that there's another type `LargeInt` which serves another purpose._\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\nFunctions on `ScVal`. Close proximity to `ScVal` so that the functionality is discoverable, and less new concepts (`XdrLargeInt`, `ScInt`) are introduced).\n\nExpand the existing ScVal functions to accept Number/BigInt:\n```diff\n-xdr.ScVal.scvI128(value: xdr.Int128Parts): xdr.ScVal\n+xdr.ScVal.scvI128(value: xdr.Int128Parts | BigInt): xdr.ScVal\n```\n\nAdd functions for converting from ScVal to Number/BigInt:\n```js\nconst bigint = scval.toBigInt();\nconst number = scval.toNumber(); // with check\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\nAnother option would be to focus on using just one of these methods, such as combining `ScInt` and `XdrLargeInt` so all conversions (simple and advanced) are in one type, and removing `scValToBigInt` since it's superfluous.\n\n### Additional context\nThinking about this after seeing the following question in Discord:\n- https://discord.com/channels/897514728459468821/1189109010754977802\n\nHistorically we've tried to pull people away from the XDR, and hide the XDR where possible behind nicer APIs. With Soroban folks need to embrace the XDR more than they did with classic operations. Also, in this case the APIs we've pulled people from to are still relatively confusing, and we can introduce less concepts by pushing people back to the XDR type and adding functions to simplify interaction on the XDR type.\n\n(I am more interested in solving the problem than with the solution I suggest above, and definitely defer to others more qualified for better solutions.)",

In case of server applications this can also potentially provide an exploitable surface for DoS attacks for NodeJS or resource exhaustion for cloud edge-computing runtimes like Cloudflare Workers and Vercel Functions.\r\n\r\nBesides that, packages required for the cryptography, significantly increase size of the client-side bundle.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to change API of all hashing/signing functions and methods exposed by `stellar-base` to return `Promise`, and therefore, make all these functions async.\r\n\r\nMotivation: \r\n- Such CPU-intensive calls won't block the main thread.\r\n- This will allow us to drop `sha.js` and `tweetnacl` dependencies, replacing them with native built-in calls (NodeJS [Crypto API](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) and browser-based [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto)). At this moment, \r\n  - [x] SHA256 is fully supported on all major platforms via Web Crypto API.\r\n  - [x] ED25519 is fully supported in NodeJS from v12.\r\n  - [ ] ED25519 addition to the Web Crypto API is on the final [standardization phase](https://wicg.github.io/webcrypto-secure-curves/), and has been already [implemented](https://github.com/WICG/webcrypto-secure-curves/issues/20) by all major platforms except Gecko. So at the moment it will require a polyfill for browsers. However, the polyfill will be automatically excluded from the bundle builds once ED25519 support is rolled in browsers.\r\n  - [x] NodeJS has full compatibility and support of both SHA256 and ED25519 via [Web Crypto API](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/webcrypto.html#webcrypto_web_crypto_api) since version v16.17.0 (LTS). So if we target only LTS Node versions, it's possible to utilize a unified interface for native API calls across NodeJS and browsers.\r\n- Since this is a breaking change, which will require some work from maintainers to update client-side code, it makes sense to align this change with other breaking changes caused by Soroban-related updates. Otherwise, we'll have to wait for the next opportunity because this breaking change by itself is not that significant to force ecosystem developers to do refactor on their side.\r\n\r\nIf this looks good, I'll prepare a pull-request.",

I believe we should treat them as first-class citizens in the SDK, and this would help facilitate that.\r\n\r\n_Compatibility_\r\nWe *may* be able to avoid breaking backwards compatibility with naming clashes if we name it `AccountInterface` instead of `Account`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAn API proposal follows:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface AccountInterface {\r\n  accountId(): string;\r\n  sequenceNumber(): string;\r\n  incrementSequenceNumber(): void;\r\n\r\n  equals(otherAccount: AccountInterface): boolean;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are the three fundamental things any proper account should be able to provide.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass Account implements AccountInterface {\r\n  constructor(accountId: string, sequence: string);\r\n\r\n  /* implementing AccountInterface */\r\n  accountId(): string;\r\n  sequenceNumber(): string;\r\n  incrementSequenceNumber(): void;\r\n\r\n  createMuxedAccount(id: string): MuxedAccount;\r\n\r\n  toXDRObject(): xdr.AccountId;\r\n  equals(otherAccount: AccountInterface): boolean;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be the interface-compatible version of the current `Account` object.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass MuxedAccount implements AccountInterface {\r\n  constructor(account: Account, sequence: string);\r\n\r\n  static fromAddress(address: string, sequenceNum: string): MuxedAccount;\r\n  static extractUnderlyingAddress(address: string): string;\r\n\r\n  /* implementing AccountInterface */\r\n  accountId(): string;\r\n  sequenceNumber(): string;\r\n  incrementSequenceNumber(): void;\r\n\r\n  getId(): string;\r\n  setId(id: string): MuxedAccount;\r\n\r\n  baseAccount(): Account;\r\n  toXDRObject(): xdr.MuxedAccount;\r\n  equals(otherAccount: MuxedAccount): boolean;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be the interface-compatible upgrade to the current `MuxedAccount` object.",

E.g.\r\n- at some places it is confusing whenever you need an address of existing account, random publicKey or just a string.\r\n- when any typeguarded XDR is serialized and then parsed again, it again loses it's narrowed type\r\n- Typescript wont catch if I'm messing up any of the following: PublicKey, Address, AccountId, Secret, Transaction hash, serialized transaction, signature, and perhaps more.\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI propose to [brand](https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-types#brandt-u) all those strings. That way TypeScript compiler can pick up all the problems. Something like this:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Brand } from 'utility-types';\r\n\r\ntype PublicKey = Brand<string, \"PublicKey\">\r\ntype Secret = Brand<string, \"Secret\">\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nclass Keypair {\r\n    static fromSecret(secret: Secret): PublicKey\r\n    //...\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst publicKey = Keypair.fromSecret(Secret)\r\nKeypair.fromSecret(publicKey)  // <-- TypeScript will complain here.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis even has potential to track the narrowed types through serialization if needed.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nLess strict alternative is to use simple aliases and excessive comments.\r\n```ts\r\n/**\r\n * Do not pass where Secret is expected, please!!!\r\n */\r\ntype PublicKey: string\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Related: #176, https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/32025",

This is an object with shape `{ minTime: UnixTimestamp }`. (Note that after building, the `timebounds` property will also have a `maxTime` property, but `TransactionBuilder` won't use the `maxTime` property you pass to the constructor if you later call `setTimeout`.)\r\n* You _must_ call `TransactionBuilder.prototype.setTimeout`, which takes a positive integer or zero. At this point, it sets the actual `timebounds` property used in the built transaction. \r\n* If you provide a positive timeout, It sets the `minTime` to zero if you didn't instantiate with `timebounds`, or `timebounds.minTime` if you did. The `maxTime` is the user's local time + the timeout.\r\n* If you provide a zero timeout, it sets the timebounds to `null` (if not instantiated) or whatever you provided (if instantiated).\r\n* The resulting transaction object has a `timeBounds` property, with a capital B.\r\n* There's no obvious way of setting a specific minTime and maxTime combo, which is required if we're going to allow \"presigning.\".\r\n* Because the official timestamp timebounds are set when `setTimeout` is called, and not when the transaction is signed, transactions can inadvertently time out if you have a complicated way of signing (for example, on StellarX, if you have to enter your password or confirm on your Ledger to complete signing.)\r\n\r\nHere's my proposal for making this simpler and more internally consistent.\r\n\r\n- [ ] `TransactionBuilder` can be instantiated with a `timeBounds` property, and that's how it's spelled internally. Instantiating with `timebounds` will save to `timeBounds`.\r\n- [ ] Instantiation `timeBounds` accepts an object `{ minTime, maxTime }`. Everything is _optional_. \r\n- [ ] If not instantiated with a value, `minTime` is set to zero.\r\n- [ ] If not instantiated with a value, `maxTime` is set to the current time, plus 60 seconds.\r\n- [ ] If `timeBounds` is not provided, then the transaction won't time out; it'll be valid forever.\r\n- [ ] `TransactionBuilder` will have functions `setMinTimestamp`, `setMaxTimestamp`, `setTimeout`, and `cancelTimeout` to manipulate timeBounds.\r\n- [ ] Make it insanely clear that the \"timeout clock\" starts when the transaction is built, so signing had better happen during the timeout!\r\n- [ ] During `build`, if minTime >= maxTime, throw.\r\n",

E.g. SonarX, whose description states that it is an indexer. I was also looking for Quasar and saw that there was a specific page for Galexie provider. Same goes with Dune which I also thought would be listed as an indexer.\n\nAfter discussing with @chadoh and others, we all seem to have varying definitions on what is an indexer, a data provider, something else.\n\nHence, I would suggest to flatten and simplify the structure to help users find their way. Have a single Analytics-Indexing section (name to be defined) and have a single provider page for it, with sections if we want to separate concerns.\n\nReviewing this, I also found some other services which could be added: Zettablock (I read there is a SDF partnership even?), Bitwave (had a SCF), BlockEden, 3xpl, Ginco, Bitquery.\n\nSome products seem to also gain capabilities. e.g. Quicknode shows on their page that indexing like features might be coming soon.

With auto-restoration accessing archived entries should be rather rare, so maybe we should rephrase this section from the security angle instead, i.e. answering the question like 'what if my entry is archived and someone tried to do something about it without performing [auto]restoration'.",

[One such page](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/guides/cli/payments-and-assets) has an obvious typo whereby there is no period at the end of a sentence, which might be caused by a lack of a functional `✏ Edit this page` button. 🤔 Might we make it easier to rectify this and future typos for further [contributions](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs/issues/799), and maybe even entice creative permissionless innovation?[^idea] At a minimum, the diction across the Guides might benefit from consistent \"[proper](https://github.com/github/.github/pull/447)\" syntax.\n\n[^idea]: Innovation in the sense that anyone could easily ready, ideate, and upgrade the docs. 💡\n\n### What would you like to see?\nI can think of two solutions to this challenge. 💭\n\n1. **Preferred Simplicity:** 🌌 Change the edit links to reference the actual base page via yarn build settings.\n\n2. **Technical Explainer:** 👩‍🏭 Add `README` explainers to the direct pages to edit in GitHub for all instances[^ident] where this happens.[^dir]\n\n[^dir]: One option could be to duplicate instructions for each placement in the parent directory of the rendered source host. 📂\n\n[^ident]: This issue presumes we can identify all the places in the code where this phenomenon happens. As I understand it, Tyler originally migrated this guide, but others likely have a wholistic concept on the infrastructure side. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦\n\n### What alternatives are there?\nWe could leave it as challenging as it is to edit a relatively large amount of the Stellar docs. While this could be an easier approach, I think we can look at the state of XRPL's documentation to see just how well the closed-source approach works. Might we make [crowdsourced documentation](https://lnns.co/XZKSL8TebGj) a staple of the network? 🤝\n\n",

Some have only javascript examples, and some have different mixes of python, go, and java. This would be confusing if someone were following these guides one-after-another and trying to learn all of the \"Stellar Basics\".\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nAdd coverage/examples for all of the pages in all languages where they are lacking.\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\nAlternatively we could _remove_ the multi-language support and limit it to 1) only javascript or 2) only SDKs maintained by SDF (js + go). Neither of these options feel great, as at least the python SDK is very widely used. Perhaps dropping support for java might be less contentious.\n\n\n",

I think it's a bigger discussion about our documentation, but right now it's a pretty big obstacle for contract developers. Ideally, developer would like to see a document in our dev docs about how to work with TS bindings + various use cases covered (basically, copy JS doc into stellar-docs and add more code examples).\n\nNote:\n[Working with contract specs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/guides/dapps/working-with-contract-specs) page covers roughly the same ground.

This should be a simple addition of the existing doc style for this year's recordings. ⏯️ Moreover, might we consider segmenting the left sidebar by year and implementing slightly more readable titles like \"October 24?\"\n\n### What alternatives are there?\nWhen making meaningful network amendments, it could help to have an easy place to reference past decision discussions. Presently, this involves extensive web search for community articles and viewpoints, since YT video descriptions alone rarely show up via SEO. Given the material number of SDF blog posts I've seen associated with these tremendous chats, it could also work to just make all embedding legacy posts include a `meetings` tab in the RSS feed. 📺\n\n",

      "body": "I think we need to discuss some of the harmful or easy mistakes to make with contract data, that can result in a contract not scaling, or getting stuck when data grows past a certain size.\n\nThe main case that's come up recently is seeing folks try to use the built in container types `soroban_sdk::{Vec, Map}` to hold what could be unbounded collections and storing those collections in a single contract data entry.\n\nThe docs on storage, such as the page below, don't discuss how collections stored in contract data ledger entries \n- https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/storage/persisting-data\n\nProblems arise when contract callers can cause collections to grow. Contract data ledger entries are limited in size by the max size for any ledger entry. This means there's a point where writing new data to a collection will result in an error, because it won't be able to be written back out. Even before that limit is reached the fees related to building and writing the collection at that size may be impractical in terms of other resource costs.\n\nSeparate to size constraints the use of collections in a single entry, where multiple users may write to, will cause congestion since all transactions writing to the shared collection would need to occur serially. This will make using the contract more expensive since it won't be able to utilise multiple execution lanes. Simulation is likely to fail to estimate the cost of doing so if it is being written to by multiple users inside a single ledger.\n\nCollections that are inherently unbounded in size should instead be stored with each individual entry in the collection being a separate contract data ledger entry. There's an unmerged example for how to do that here:\n- https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/pull/369\n\nThis topic would also be a good candidate for a \"do-not-do\" style page, such as like the on that Postgres has in its wiki:\n- https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This",

Materially, the signature implications ought be extensively detailed per key custody implications.\n\n### What alternatives are there? 💭\nWe could require new users to learn all this when they start messing around with the Lab, but that may not be ideal.

      "body": "This has been requested by a few parties in the ecosystem. For Dev Survey\n\n```\nIf I could change one thing about Soroban it would be this.\n\nAll contracts in Soroban are upgradeable by default. This enables developers to update their code at any point. I think this was implemented to enable upgradeable contract functionality as standard without the need for proxies which are widely used in other platforms.\n\nWhen I write smart contract code it is always for one of two reasons:\n\nI’m writing a contract that is just going to be run by myself. I can use ownable libraries to ensure no one else can run it and proxies to enable me to upgrade it at a later date. This would be akin to a script run locally which might be doing something like trading or automating a DeFi strategy. There is absolutely no problem with having these contracts upgradeable because they are fully centralized around myself as the developer anyway.\nI’m writing a contract that is going to be run by anyone and everyone. For this we should strive to make the contracts permissionless so that all users including the original developer have equal permissions and code is law. An example would be a fair launch token contract where the initial balance is minted and put on a DEX when deployed and then everyone has the same rights within that contract. The developer should not be able to mint new tokens or change the logic within that code, he/she should have the same access as everyone else.\n\nThe reason I am obsessed with blockchain technology is because it gives me the ability to deploy immutable permissionless code on censorship resistant decentralized peer to peer networks. There is something elegantly beautiful and pure about this, even if we do use it to create memecoins.\n\nThere are no permissionless contracts on Soroban!\n\nApparently there is a way you can add something to the code to disable the upgrade functionality but I’ve seen no documentation of this or examples of it being used in practice. Every single contract deployed on Soroban has a single point of failure. The private keys used to deploy the contract can be used at any time to “upgrade” the logic within that contract.\n\nIf a lending platform holds pools of assets a developer could at any time upgrade the contract to inject a backdoor allowing them to steal all the assets.\n\nDevelopers, as well meaning as we are, should not be trusted as default. We saw a very sophisticated attack on Radiant capital where hackers were able to compromise an outgoing transaction from the developers device. If Soroban is successful and ends up having billions of dollars in TVL then the Lazarus group will have an absolute field day compromising dev wallets and upgrading contracts for fun and profit.\n\nI believe proxy contracts are over-used on Ethereum where they maybe make up 5-10% of all deployed contracts (you can tell in etherscan if a contract uses a upgradeable proxy pattern). Having 100% of contracts upgradeable is a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nIt also opens the platform up to criticism. If someone is on a public panel debating “Stellar vs Solana” and Anatoly fires off “why are all contracts on Stellar centralized?” how do we justify or explain that?\n\nIt is going to be difficult for Soroban to compete with Ethereum, Solana and other emerging decentralized computing platforms over the next decade. It is impossible and pointless to build permissioned systems to compete with AWS and Gcloud.\n\nThe whole point of web3 is that we can build trustless code and upgradeable contracts are not trustless or permissionless. They are useful for certain things but should not be default or a feature of the Soroban platform.\n\nThere are a couple of resources here which I think would be very valuable:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XlYSmIlpfs\n\nhttps://diligence.consensys.io/blog/2019/01/upgradeability-is-a-bug/\n```\n",

Thanks! -->\n\n### What problem does your feature solve?\n\nI am making tutorials on the lab and been using Lumen Loop's [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_fJYoHKG8E) as a reference. They use Horizon's [GET /accounts/{address}](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/apis/horizon/api-reference/retrieve-an-account) to check the end balance as a result of the tx in the address they're using; however, according to our [migration doc endpoint mapping from horizon to rpc](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/apis/migrate-from-horizon-to-rpc#endpoint-mapping), using `getLedgerEntries` rpc endpoint is recommended for the response that users expect from horizon's `GET /accounts/{address}`.\n\nHowever, we need to provide more information on their differences. For example, horizon's address endpoint will provide `trustlines` and `balances` where as `getLedgerEntries`'s `account` ledgerKey does not. That's because ([slack](https://stellarfoundation.slack.com/archives/C06KTGUULUF/p1753231179334809)):\n\n> the response from horizon’s “account details” is an aggregation of an account entry and its associates trustline entries (and IIRC also data entries). The low level account ledger entry does not actually contain trustlines\n\nAnother example of the difference is how each endpoint displays a balance of an asset. For `5 USDC`, horizon returns a balance `of 5.0000000` whereas `getLedgerEntries`'s  `trustline` ledgerKey returns the **raw value** of `50000000` (the raw value represents stroops which are worth 10^-7 of the actual asset is **an out-of-protocol convention**).\n\nAs we're moving from a very opinionated indexer to a raw rpc, we should document all of this information to make it easier for Stellar developers to migrate from horizon to rpc.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nExcellent doc that explains the differences between horizon and rpc endpoints with examples. Start with the most used horizon endpoint and compare the differences\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\nNone",

The [present](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/apis/horizon/api-reference/aggregations/paths) page only explains path-payment route options.\n\n### What problem does your feature solve?\n\nDocument the sheep-wheat exchange pathfinding logic. Users can confidently transact with more info on order matchmaking. I find it particularly important to explain how this works for market orders taking liquidity.\n\nNamely, market orders are the most common for individuals uninformed about spreads or slippage. For an easy remittance payment, they offer the simplest instant transfer conversion. Regulators care a lot about fair execution, and I don’t like the growing alternative of private implementations which tend towards off-chain calculations.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nTo start, a page explaining the routing of offers which consummate in `ClaimAtom` responses. This could explain, e.g., the CAP-38 solo-pool path execution before worse offers. We could differentiate the DEX via further information about this in the dev docs.\n\nGenerally, the network's liquidity allows for a deep reliance on conversion, especially for native assets. But the present documentation doesn't get this point across. Perhaps we could move pathfinding logic into a standalone `Encyclopedia > SDEX` page referencing paths.\n\n_See also_ #944 in re consolidating liquidity documentation. There's already so much on transaction ordering fairness, as showcased in _Straight Facts_ earlier this year. It'd be great to have equivalent detailed public information for order hopping.\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\nI'm mostly concerned with how validators treat unspecified trade routing, since users share the common goal of best execution. This doesn’t stand out in one sentence and subsection example on independent hops at `Txs (specialized) > Path Payments`. To reiterate the prescient words of a meaningful early developer:\n\n> Pathfinding is key for devs making wallets that support remittance payments. It's worth doing it right, since that's a central goal of Stellar.  \n> — [Tom Quisel](https://github.com/stellar/go/issues/849)\n\nSome clients currently offload this to a custom implementation.[^A] This is a lot of extra work to squeeze the most out of execution. Systems like these could serve as documentation inspiration.\n\nNamely, I know Silence and Orbit work on contract-based best execution. We could have a page more geared towards community pathfinding solutions, explaining their open-source code. This would be a stark contrast from the protocol-level Horizon implementation now documented.\n\n[^A]: Looking at community members like @johansten who’ve been helping me further understand the nuances here 💜 and built their own Horizon comparison servers. 🧠\n",

The platform does, however, save the raw XDR on the `history_transactions` table. This means that _any_ element in XDR is accessible to end users. We should write a tutorial that shows people how to parse raw XDR and when it's appropriate to do so.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nA tutorial and code stubs that demonstrate how to use the JS SDK in conjunction with BigQuery UDFs to access a data element that is available in the XDR, but not in Hubble's data schema.\n\n@amishas157 has already backfilled data in Hubble using this method, so this should just organize some of her work and demonstrate that this is possible. This is an advanced concept that should live under `Admin Guide` > `Data Curation` or a `Developer Guide`\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\n\n",

There is a possibility to convert WASM into WASM Text (WAT), and be able to show on how the code execution path. Eventually with a sourcemap, we can connect the WAT to the actual Rust source code. However, this is currently missing and we do not have sourcemap of Rust to WASM. \n\nWhat is possible Today\nWhat is possible today is to reconstruct the functional calls and events into an execution tree. Likely we are not able to show internal contract calls, but it is possible to show external contract calls, and associated events. In some ways, Stellar Expert seeks to do this: [example](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/contract/CA4HEQTL2WPEUYKYKCDOHCDNIV4QHNJ7EL4J4NQ6VADP7SYHVRYZ7AW2). But it appears that the contract invocation and related events that are raised are out of order.\n\n<img width=\"711\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51deedd7-5d08-4b5b-bfdf-61103d7dd8b7\" />\n\n",

Currently, there's no easy way to visually distinguish between them, which can lead to confusion about which version you're interacting with.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd clear visual indicators for local/development builds:\n\n### 1. Different Extension Icon\n- Use a modified icon for dev builds (e.g., add a colored badge, use a different color scheme, or add a \"DEV\" label overlay)\n- This makes it immediately obvious in the browser toolbar which extension is the development version\n\n### 2. In-App Indicator\n- Add a visible banner or badge within the extension UI indicating it's a development build\n- Could be a small \"DEV\" or \"LOCAL\" badge in the header/footer\n- Or a colored border/background tint\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Prevents accidentally testing on the wrong build\n- Reduces confusion when debugging\n- Improves developer experience for contributors\n- Common practice in other browser extensions and applications\n\n## Implementation Ideas\n\n- Use webpack's `DefinePlugin` to inject a `IS_DEV_BUILD` flag\n- Conditionally load different icon assets based on build type\n- Add a small UI component that only renders in development mode\n\n---\n*Suggestion from local development experience*",

I ask Freighter (logged in as the depositor `GDOR...WSXS2PYRSF`) to sign and submit this **funding_tx_xdr**.\n\n---\n\n### What did you expect to see?\n\nGiven:\n\n- Depositor USDC state from Horizon:\n\n- `balance=4.0000000`  \n- `selling_liabilities=0.0000000`  \n- `buying_liabilities=0.0000000`  \n- So spendable USDC ≈ 4.0.\n\n- Funding tx debits:\n\n- 2.0 USDC to escrow.  \n- 0.10 USDC to treasury (min 0.10 USDC fee in my app).  \n- Total: 2.1 USDC.\n\nI expected Freighter to:\n\n- Consider the USDC “unliable balance” sufficient (4.0 − 2.1 = 1.9 > 0).  \n- Sign and submit the transaction successfully.  \n\n---\n\n### What did you see instead?\n\nFreighter rejected the funding transaction with:\n\nReverted: Operation: Payment (operation index: 0) reverted:\nAccount GDORW6B4VC77W5XP2JTRWBJTQGXAMUABHNRQLFSGM5N2MXWSXS2PYRSF\nhas insufficient balance for asset $USDC after operation.\nCurrent unliable balance: 4, diff: 20000000\n\nKey observations:\n\n- The error is for **asset $USDC** on the **depositor** account, not XLM.  \n- “Current unliable balance: 4” matches the Horizon `balance=4.0000000`.  \n- “diff: 20000000” is exactly 2.0 USDC in base units (10_000_000 = 1.0).  \n\nHowever, the transaction is trying to spend **2.1 USDC** when there are 4.0 USDC and 0 liabilities. From the protocol’s point of view, this should be accepted:\n\n- 4.0 (balance) − 2.1 (payment + fee) = 1.9 USDC remaining, still well above zero.  \n\nBut Freighter behaves as if the unliable USDC balance is insufficient by **2.0 USDC**, despite Horizon reporting:\n\nbalance=4.0000000\nselling_liabilities=0.0000000\nbuying_liabilities=0.0000000\n\n\nand no other operations from this account between my `log_usdc_state` call and the Freighter signing step.\n\nIt looks like Freighter’s internal “unliable balance” calculation for this USDC trustline on testnet is stricter or inconsistent with Horizon: it rejects a transaction that Horizon reports as clearly funded (4.0 spendable vs 2.1 required), and the `diff` in the error (20000000) does not match the actual (USDC balance − payment − fee) delta.\n\nIf it helps, I can provide:\n\n- The full `funding_tx_xdr` shown above.  \n- Links to the Horizon / Explorer views for the depositor and escrow accounts on testnet.  \n\nThis seems like a narrow testnet edge case (non-native asset, repeated escrow tests, small but not “dust” amounts), but it makes Freighter reject valid USDC payments from this account.",

While Wallet BE is not quite production ready, we can start testing using this endpoint in staging env's to test in the `/wallets` view. Because we only need account balances in this view to get an estimate of USD value, this is a fairly low risk place to test. When we feel this endpoint is prod ready, we can try enabling the use of this endpoint on this view in prod using a feature flag.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n* Create a `is_wallet_be_enabled` feature flag in amplitude\n* In Freighter, implement the Amplitude SDK to use this `is_wallet_be_enabled` flag\n* In the `useGetWalletsData.tsx` hook, add the ability to use the `GetMultipleAccountBalances` endpoint in Freighter BE v2 if   `is_wallet_be_enabled === true` to fetch all account balances\n* Enable `is_wallet_be_enabled` in local/staging env's to test if this is working\n\n",

We do this by first making an API request for the wallet's account balances, and then we pass that info on to the token prices endpoint to get the USD value. \n\nThis can be a lot of API requests. We should streamline this by creating an endpoint that fetches both account balances and USD in one request or adding an exponential backoff for 429's.\n\nNote that this doesn't break the UI for users - we just simply stop showing USD prices for each wallet. The user will, however, be blocked from further API requests until the timeout resolves.\n\nHow we can solve this in a tiered approach:\n\nFirst, we are making a request for `/token-prices` for each balance. We can simply gather one list of _all_ these assets a user has across wallets and make one request to  `/token-prices` and use that list to get the USD balance for each balance. We will still need to make a request for each account balances. This changes from the number of requests this view makes from `n * 2` to `n+1`\n\nIn a follow up ticket, we can further reduce this to simply 2 requests using Wallet BE's `GetMultipleAccountBalances` query\n",

Beans does not need to save user data.\n\n- Yes we have a front end in the interactive flow (SEP-24). We only use the SEP's. Everything is implemented according to the protocol with no exceptions in order to make an integration straightforward and compatible if the protocol is followed.\n- You can experience the default [SEP-24](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md) interactive flow (frontend) on testnet by following these steps:\n1. Head over to [Stellar Demo Wallet](https://demo-wallet.stellar.org/)\n2. Generate new key pair\n3. Fund new wallet in the [lab](https://lab.stellar.org/account/fund?$=network$id=testnet&label=Testnet&horizonUrl=https:////horizon-testnet.stellar.org&rpcUrl=https:////soroban-testnet.stellar.org&passphrase=Test%20SDF%20Network%20/;%20September%202015;;)\n4. Refresh the account in demo wallet, there should now be testnet XLM in the wallet\n5. Click add asset - asset code: EURC anchor home domain [dev.stellar.mykobo.co](http://dev.stellar.mykobo.co/)\n6. The home domain is [stellar.mykobo.co](http://stellar.mykobo.co/) on mainnet\n7. Select action: SEP-24 Deposit\n8. You should now be presented with the first interactive screen\n\nThese steps are performed by the integrating partner for SEP-6 and SEP-24. For SEP-24 the interactive flow continues; for SEP-6 (headless), the integrating partner manages the rest on their end following the SEP-6 protocol. If the email address provided on the first screen is for a verified user they continue; otherwise KYC kicks in.\n\nWe can also provide a custom SEP-24 frontend if you send us the client_domain parameter as well as stylesheet, logo etc, attached is an example for Vortex by Satoshipay.\nWe use the Stellar Anchor Platform and If you have questions about SEP-6, someone from Jake's team can help [@K](https://stellarfoundation.slack.com/team/UL1TKH152) would know our contact while Jake is away.\n",

If they do, we automatically add those keypairs to Freighter so the user can see the balances. In the wallets list dropdown, we show the `imported` label next to these wallets.\n\nWe actually also use this `imported` label for accounts that were added by S key (that are not related to the seed phrase at all). This was according to spec at the time, but we are now thinking that this may be a bit confusing: `imported` means 2 different things.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n\n* Remove the `imported` label from keypairs derived from the seed phrase that had a balance\n* The `imported` label should remain for accounts imported by private key\n\nNOTE: This is how it works in Mobile already, so no need to do this work in that repo, too\n\n",

These search results should show assets that:\n1. In the asset lists accessible by the user\n2. available to be added as a trustline",

These unused types increase WASM binary size unnecessarily.\n\nAny exported `contracttypes` defined in the SDK, or any library for that matter, that don't get used in the importing contract still end up in the contract spec. This results in some awkward behaviour where we avoid exporting contracttypes in the SDK, even though doing so would be convenient and enable using contracttypes more frequently there.\n\nBecause of how proc-macros run in isolation and cannot coordinate in wasm builds in Rust (the ctor crate cannot be used like we use it in non-wasm builds in tests to coordinate), there's nothing the soroban-sdk can do to identify whether a contracttype that sometimes needs to be exported hasn't been used and can be excluded.\n\nExamples of unused types that bloat the spec:\n- Error enums from imported libraries (e.g., `#[contracterror]` types from dependencies) that are never used by any function\n- Types that are defined but never referenced by any function inputs/outputs\n- Transitive type dependencies that no longer apply after refactoring\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nDuring `stellar contract build`, automatically filter the `contractspecv0` section to remove unused types:\n\n1. Parse the spec entries from the compiled WASM after cargo build\n2. Perform reachability analysis starting from all functions using fixed-point iteration\n3. Keep:\n   - All functions (`FunctionV0`)\n   - All events (`EventV0`)\n   - All UDTs (`UdtStructV0`, `UdtUnionV0`, `UdtEnumV0`, `UdtErrorEnumV0`) that are directly or transitively referenced by function inputs/outputs\n4. Remove: UDT types that are defined but never referenced by any function\n5. Replace the `contractspecv0` custom section with the filtered version using `wasm-encoder`\n\nTypes reference other types via `ScSpecTypeDef::Udt(name)`. The reachability analysis recursively traverses `Vec`, `Map`, `Option`, `Result`, and `Tuple` type definitions to find all referenced UDTs.\n\nThis will require rewriting the wasm file after build. Currently the stellar-cli does modify the wasm (for meta injection), but only in an append fashion. The new approach uses `wasm-encoder` with `RawSection` to copy sections verbatim and replace only the target custom section.\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\n- **Manual cleanup**: Developers could manually remove unused type imports, but this is error-prone and tedious\n- **SDK-level filtering**: The Soroban SDK could avoid emitting unused types, but proc-macros run in isolation and cannot coordinate to identify unused types\n- **Filter by library**: Only filter types exported from the soroban-sdk (types can specify what library they came from), but filtering all unused types is more comprehensive\n\n### Related\n\n- https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues/1569",

      "body": "## Summary\n\nAdd support for signing and verifying arbitrary messages per [SEP-53](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0053.md). This capability is already implemented in [Freighter](https://github.com/stellar/freighter) and enables proving Stellar address ownership, off-chain agreement verification, and cross-chain integrations.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, the Stellar CLI can sign transactions but lacks the ability to sign arbitrary messages. This is a common need for:\n\n- **Proof of ownership**: Proving control of a Stellar address on social platforms, Discord bots, etc.\n- **Off-chain agreements**: Signing messages for legal/contractual purposes without on-chain transactions\n- **Cross-chain integrations**: Verifying Stellar address ownership in multi-chain applications\n- **Authentication**: Using Stellar keys as an authentication mechanism\n\nFreighter wallet already supports this via their `signMessage` API, but CLI users currently have no equivalent capability.\n\n## Proposed Command Structure\n\nFollowing the existing CLI architecture patterns (hierarchical subcommands, consistent signing options), I propose a new `message` subcommand:\n\n```\nstellar message sign    Sign an arbitrary message using SEP-53\nstellar message verify  Verify a SEP-53 signed message\n```\n\n### `stellar message sign`\n\n```\nstellar message sign [OPTIONS] <MESSAGE>\n\nArguments:\n  <MESSAGE>  The message to sign (use --file for binary/file input)\n\nOptions:\n  -f, --file <FILE>           Read message from file instead of argument\n      --binary                Treat input as binary data (not UTF-8 text)\n      --sign-with-key <KEY>   Sign with a local key or identity\n      --sign-with-lab         Sign using https://lab.stellar.org\n      --sign-with-ledger      Sign using a Ledger hardware wallet\n      --hd-path <HD_PATH>     HD derivation path (if using seed phrase)\n  -o, --output <FORMAT>       Output format [default: text] [possible: text, json]\n```\n\n**Example usage:**\n```bash\n# Sign a simple message\nstellar message sign \"Hello, World!\" --sign-with-key alice\n\n# Sign with JSON output\nstellar message sign \"Verify I own this address\" --sign-with-key alice --output json\n\n# Sign binary file\nstellar message sign --file document.pdf --binary --sign-with-key alice\n\n# Sign using Ledger\nstellar message sign \"Proof of ownership\" --sign-with-ledger\n```\n\n**Output (text):**\n```\nSigner: GBXFXNDLV4LSWA4VB7YIL5GBD7BVNR22SGBTDKMO2SBZZHDXSKZYCP7L\nSignature: fO5dbYhXUhBMhe6kId/cuVq/AfEnHRHEvsP8vXh03M1uLpi5e46yO2Q8rEBzu3feXQewcQE5GArp88u6ePK6BA==\n```\n\n**Output (json):**\n```json\n{\n  \"signer\": \"GBXFXNDLV4LSWA4VB7YIL5GBD7BVNR22SGBTDKMO2SBZZHDXSKZYCP7L\",\n  \"message\": \"Hello, World!\",\n  \"signature\": \"fO5dbYhXUhBMhe6kId/cuVq/AfEnHRHEvsP8vXh03M1uLpi5e46yO2Q8rEBzu3feXQewcQE5GArp88u6ePK6BA==\"\n}\n```\n\n### `stellar message verify`\n\n```\nstellar message verify [OPTIONS] <MESSAGE> <SIGNATURE>\n\nArguments:\n  <MESSAGE>    The original message\n  <SIGNATURE>  The base64-encoded signature to verify\n\nOptions:\n  -f, --file <FILE>         Read message from file instead of argument\n      --binary              Treat input as binary data (not UTF-8 text)\n  -p, --public-key <KEY>    Public key or identity to verify against\n  -o, --output <FORMAT>     Output format [default: text] [possible: text, json]\n```\n\n**Example usage:**\n```bash\n# Verify a signature\nstellar message verify \"Hello, World!\" \\\n  \"fO5dbYhXUhBMhe6kId/cuVq/AfEnHRHEvsP8vXh03M1uLpi5e46yO2Q8rEBzu3feXQewcQE5GArp88u6ePK6BA==\" \\\n  --public-key GBXFXNDLV4LSWA4VB7YIL5GBD7BVNR22SGBTDKMO2SBZZHDXSKZYCP7L\n\n# Verify using an identity name\nstellar message verify \"Hello, World!\" \"$SIGNATURE\" --public-key alice\n\n# JSON output for scripting\nstellar message verify \"Hello\" \"$SIG\" --public-key \"$PUBKEY\" --output json\n```\n\n**Output (text - success):**\n```\n✓ Signature valid\n```\n\n**Output (text - failure):**\n```\n✗ Signature invalid\n```\n\n**Output (json):**\n```json\n{\n  \"valid\": true,\n  \"signer\": \"GBXFXNDLV4LSWA4VB7YIL5GBD7BVNR22SGBTDKMO2SBZZHDXSKZYCP7L\",\n  \"message\": \"Hello, World!\"\n}\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\nPer SEP-53, the signing process is:\n1. Convert message to bytes (UTF-8 if string, raw if binary)\n2. Prepend the fixed prefix: `\"Stellar Signed Message:\\n\"`\n3. Compute `hash = SHA256(prefix + message)`\n4. Sign `hash` with ed25519 private key → 64-byte signature\n5. Return signature as base64\n\n## Test Vectors\n\nSEP-53 provides test vectors that should be used for validation:\n\n| Message | Signature (base64) |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| `Hello, World!` | `fO5dbYhXUhBMhe6kId/cuVq/AfEnHRHEvsP8vXh03M1uLpi5e46yO2Q8rEBzu3feXQewcQE5GArp88u6ePK6BA==` |\n| `こんにちは、世界！` | `CDU265Xs8y3OWbB/56H9jPgUss5G9A0qFuTqH2zs2YDgTm+++dIfmAEceFqB7bhfN3am59lCtDXrCtwH2k1GBA==` |\n\n(Using seed `SAKICEOVQLYWGSOJS4WW7HZJWAHZVEEBS527LHK5V4MLJALYKICQCJXMW`)\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n1. **`stellar keys sign-message` / `stellar keys verify-message`**: Places commands under `keys`, but makes the subcommand less focused on key management\n2. **`stellar sign` / `stellar verify`**: Top-level commands, but could conflict with future additions\n3. **`stellar tx sign-message`**: Under `tx`, but messages aren't transactions\n\nThe `stellar message` subcommand provides clear separation and room for future message-related features.\n\n## References\n\n- [SEP-53 Specification](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0053.md)\n- [Freighter signMessage API](https://docs.freighter.app/docs/playground/signmessage/)\n- [Freighter Repository](https://github.com/stellar/freighter)",

When using `--build-only` to just build the transaction (e.g., to later simulate it), there's no need for an actual account.\n\n**Use case:** A developer wants to simulate uploading a contract to mainnet to estimate costs, but doesn't have an account configured. Since the upload operation requires no auth, they should be able to build and simulate the transaction without needing a real account.\n\n**Current workaround:** On mainnet, you can work around this by specifying any existing account as the source:\n\n```bash\nstellar contract upload --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/test_empty.wasm --build-only --source GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWHF | stellar tx simulate\n```\n\nThis works because the account just needs to exist for the simulation, but it's not intuitive and requires knowing about an arbitrary existing account.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nWhen using `--build-only`, the `--source` option should either:\n- Be optional, with the CLI using a placeholder/zero account automatically, or\n- Accept a special value indicating \"any account\" or \"simulation mode\"\n\nThis would allow commands like:\n```bash\nstellar contract upload --wasm contract.wasm --build-only | stellar tx simulate\n```\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\n- Use any known existing account as `--source` (current workaround shown above)\n- Configure a local identity even when you don't need one",

This option is not available on `contract upload` or `contract deploy`, meaning users cannot use the same interface for simulating without sending. The workaround is to use `--build-only | stellar tx simulate`, but this is inconsistent with the `contract invoke` experience.\n\n2. **`--cost` option missing on `contract upload` and `contract deploy`**: The `contract invoke` command has a `--cost` option that provides visibility into the costs paid. This option is not available on `contract upload` or `contract deploy`, so users have no visibility into the costs of these operations.\n\n3. **`--cost` option missing on `stellar tx simulate`**: Even when using the workaround of piping to `stellar tx simulate`, there's no `--cost` option on that command either. Users can get back a simulated transaction, but cannot see human-friendly cost output on the command line without manually decoding the transaction to extract the costs.\n\n**Use case:** A developer wants to measure ahead of time what the cost of uploading or deploying a contract will be on mainnet. Currently there's no straightforward way to simulate these operations and see the costs without actually submitting the transaction or manually decoding XDR output.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nAny command that simulates or sends transactions with contract invoke host operations should support a consistent set of options for:\n- Deciding whether to simulate-only or send (`--send`)\n- Gaining insight into costs (`--cost`)\n\nSome examples (not exhaustive):\n- Add `--send` option to `contract upload` and `contract deploy`\n- Add `--cost` option to `contract upload` and `contract deploy`\n- Add `--cost` option to `stellar tx simulate`\n\nThere may be other commands that would benefit from these options as well. The general principle is that commands dealing with transaction simulation and submission should have a consistent interface.\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\n- Use `--build-only` and pipe to `stellar tx simulate` (but this still lacks `--cost` output)\n- Pipe the output of `stellar tx simulate` to `stellar xdr decode` to extract cost information from the transaction XDR",

Thanks! -->\n\n### What problem does your feature solve?\n\nThere was a change introduced recently to use by default a global configuration. I want to point out two issues with the change:\n\n1. This goes against a common pattern with CLIs. It's the same everywhere in the resolution order: env -> local -> global. We break an established convention and I argue that in the present case, we even have a security issue at hand since we are talking about private keys potentially used on production. I don't think we would want to mix keys used for a hackathon with keys used to deploy a contract handling millions of TVL.\n2. Process: this was a big API change and it should have been communicated to the wider community. I am now watching all the repository from the org because things like that happened a few times now. I raised my voice on a few issues already. In my opinion this is not good. I think I follow pretty well what is happening in Stellar. If someone like me gets caught by surprises by changes, it's not a good thing for folks in general. I am all for moving fast but we need to have a clear information policy and opportunity for people to engage with change.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\n1. come back to a local first approach.\n2. Any public facing API change on this repo or in general should be brought to the wider community. A minima, I would suggest creating a dedicated space on Discord to list these. You can then set a silent consensus policy as to keep the ball rolling. What really matters is that people clearly know how to keep tab on things.\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\nUp for discussion.\n\n",

For when converting from timestamp to ledger seq, it picks the closest ledger that happened just before the time.\n\n### How\n\nUsing the history archives to narrow down to a nearest checkpoint ledger (every 64th ledger), and then using the AWS Public Blockchain Dataset which has LedgerCloseMeta for every ledger in a separate file for narrowing down within that.

For example:\n```jsonc\n// ...\n\"invoke_contract\": {\n  \"contract_address\": \"CAG5LRYQ5JVEUI5TEID72EYOVX44TTUJT5BQR2J6J77FH65PCCFAJDDH\",\n  \"function_name\": \"add_liquidity\",\n  \"args\": [\n    { \"address\": \"CCW67TSZV3SSS2HXMBQ5JFGCKJNXKZM7UQUWUZPUTHXSTZLEO7SJMI75\" },\n    { \"address\": \"CAS3J7GYLGXMF6TDJBBYYSE3HQ6BBSMLNUQ34T6TZMYMW2EVH34XOWMA\" },\n    { \"i128\": \"1000000000\" },\n    { \"i128\": \"2791736460\" },\n    { \"i128\": \"1000000000\" },\n    { \"i128\": \"2791736460\" },\n    { \"u64\": \"0\" }\n  ]\n// ...\n```\n\nWhile this is really easy to read in JSON, the parameters only show the values, and not the parameter names, making it a little hard to reason about what the values mean, and potentially leading to mistakes if a developer edits the tx and sets a value in the wrong field.\n\nMost IDEs support JSONC, a form of JSON that allows for comments to appear within the JSON.\n\nThe `stellar tx edit` command could, in much the same way that it injects the `$schema`, render JSONC and to inject comments after or before each parameter so that it is unambiguous to the user what each parameter is.\n\nFor example:\n```jsonc\n// ...\n\"invoke_contract\": {\n  \"contract_address\": \"CAG5LRYQ5JVEUI5TEID72EYOVX44TTUJT5BQR2J6J77FH65PCCFAJDDH\",\n  \"function_name\": \"add_liquidity\",\n  \"args\": [\n    { \"address\": \"CCW67TSZV3SSS2HXMBQ5JFGCKJNXKZM7UQUWUZPUTHXSTZLEO7SJMI75\" }, // token_a\n    { \"address\": \"CAS3J7GYLGXMF6TDJBBYYSE3HQ6BBSMLNUQ34T6TZMYMW2EVH34XOWMA\" }, // token_b\n    { \"i128\": \"1000000000\" }, // amount_a_desired\n    { \"i128\": \"2791736460\" }, // amount_b_desired\n    { \"i128\": \"1000000000\" }, // amount_a_min\n    { \"i128\": \"2791736460\" }, // amount_b_min\n    { \"u64\": \"0\" } // deadline\n  ]\n// ...\n```",

The padding was a convenience because back then Soroban had no addresses, and hex strings were often addresses, and you could type just  `1` and get `00000...1` as an address.\n\nRegardless of that history, it is quite surprising today when you type a string like ABCD for a BytesN and it gets accepted. It is also crazy easy to mistype a fixed length byte value and it to be accepted and zero padded which might be dangerous at worse and surprising at best. In most real world use cases a user should be told the input is incomplete.\n\nFor these reasons I think it is worth a breaking change to the CLI to remove the right padding logic for both Bytes and BytesN. For both an even number of hex characters should be required, and for BytesN the length should exactly match the destination parameter.\n\nPreviously discussed in:\n- https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/issues/2239#issuecomment-3380766946:\n\ncc @jsmaxi @stellar/devx ",

Currently, there's an inconsistency: Stellar CLI automatically handles type conversions during contract invocations (e.g., accepting \"ABCD\" for a BytesN<32> parameter), but there's no standalone command to perform these conversions independently.\n\nCommon scenarios: converting strings to BytesN<32> hex format for use in Stellar Lab, encoding addresses to bytes, decoding hex values back to human-readable formats, preparing parameters for contract calls or inspection.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nEncoding/decoding commands added to the Stellar CLI:\n\n```bash\n# Encode example\nstellar contract encode --type bytes-n-32 --value \"ABCD\"\n# Output: 4142434400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\n# Decode example\nstellar contract decode --type bytes-n-32 --value \"4142434400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n# Output: ABCD (or hex if not valid UTF-8)\n```\n\nThis would reduce friction when switching between CLI and Lab and would improve developer experience.\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\nUsing Python/Node/Unix commands, custom scripts or online converters.",

Signing auths (originally part of https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/pull/1406) \nWhile it makes sense to add a new flag (`--auth-only`) to sign, moving it to a new command makes more sense it we want `tx sign` to have the same flags as other transaction signing commands. Moreover, not all transactions may have auth entries inside (in fact, most will not).\nAs such, we can add `tx auth <xdr> --sign-with-*` command that only sings auths.\n2. `--dry-run` for signing auths (https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/issues/1493) nicely follows in line with ^\n3. `auth show <xdr>` would be a great subcommand that lists all auths in this transaction, and shows which one is signed, which are not signed \n\ncc @janewang @willemneal @leighmcculloch \n",

The textual form is very convenient following natural command line patterns for most types, but is still bespoke to the CLI and is not documented. When scripting using XDR there is no clear way to convert back and forth, and passing in XDR and getting XDR back would be more convenient.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nEvery function parameter to have a corresponding `--<param>-xdr` option that can be used to pass base64 encoded XDR instead. This pattern of providing a second parameter with a different suffix is a pattern already used in the CLI on the `stellar contract read --key-xdr ...` command, and the `stellar contract invoke ... -- fn --param-file-path ...` command.\n\nAn option added to the invoke command to change the output format of the function call:\n```\n--output text|xdr\n```\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\nOpen to suggestion but the only alternatives that come to mind are inconsistent with the existing patterns noted above.\n",

Currently, we must provide a keypair for --source-account in order to form transaction. \r\nPreviously, it was always signed by the provided keypair (unless `--build-only` or `--simulate-only` were passed.

Moving some snippets of discussion captured over into GitHub issue for more async and further discussion.\r\n\r\n> @tomerweller: I wonder if there’s a modularity (or lack-thereof) issue with the current build/simulate/sign/send flow in ts-bindings. What if I want to skip simulate? For example if I want to manually fill in footprint/fees/auth? Or use a cached version of these from a similar past invocation?\r\n\r\n> @leighmcculloch: There's a break up of actions at the layer below the generated code. The SorobanClient can be used to build a tx for an invocation, to do simulation, and submit, and those three actions are independent.\r\n>\r\n> At some point we talked about there being a variety of flows for the CLI such as:\r\n> 1. Only simulate\r\n> 2. Only submit\r\n> 3. Simulate and submit\r\n> 4. Simulate and maybe submit (if footprint is write, or if events written)\r\n>\r\n> The same principles would apply in the JS/TS.\r\n> But it's helpful for us to have some good default behavior, which I think is (4).\r\n> It looks like the generated TS bindings have support for (1) and (4) at the moment via the responseType field. \r\n\r\n> @leighmcculloch: I think once the tx is built, the logic no longer needs to be part of the generated bindings. The specialty of the generated bindings is really focused on knowing what fn to call, and needing to turn that into a tx. And beyond that we could build all those other flows on a tx. So that all workflows operate around the build tx step. Something like:\r\n>\r\n> ![image](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-tools/assets/351529/65abbb28-2848-4c28-a56a-bea43390cdf2)\r\n\r\nMy comment above is a little too simplified, as @chadoh has pointed out in the slack there there's other logic currently tied up in the assembled transaction like automatic backoff for sending, rebuilding and resimulating for resending. But I think across both the CLI and the TS bindings, and in general the way the JS and other clients are structured, we need to maintain some modularity so that folks can do all of the things above, and modify state between any of them.\r\n\r\nThis was originally discussed at the end of November, so if we've already moved on from here and this is out-of-date I can close it. I'm opening this issue to capture the need for us to evaluate if we have sufficient modularity, and if we provide the above different ways to interact with the network/soroban, and to dig into this further if we aren't quite there yet.\r\n\r\nI think this issue belongs to the soroban-cli, typescript bindings, and the JS SDK.\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @chadoh @willemneal @piyalbasu @jeesunikim @Shaptic \r\n",

      "body": "**Purpose:** \r\nBased on results from load testing deposit transaction submission in Polaris (https://github.com/stellar/django-polaris/issues/589), it can be seen that transaction throughput is currently limited by Polaris only being able to submit one transaction at a time.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of channel accounts, Polaris will be be able to submit transactions to the Stellar Network in parallel (based on the number of channel accounts used).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Creating / Importing Channel Accounts Into Polaris**\r\nChannel Accounts will be created/imported into Polaris via a script. The script can be executed similar to existing Django-Polaris commands (examples below).\r\nThe secret key of the channel accounts will be encrypted in the database the same way distribution seeds are currently encrypted for Assets.\r\n\r\n**Script Features:**\r\n\r\n- \tadd a distribution base account (responsible for paying transaction fees for channel accounts - fee bumps)\r\n- \tcreate channel accounts and fund them via friendbot (testnet)\r\n- \tcreate channel accounts and fund them via a distribution account\r\n- \twrite the created channel accounts public/secret keys into the database\r\n- \tdelete all channel accounts from the database\r\n- \tcreate an Asset in Polaris (instead of having to do it manually via a python shell)\r\n- \tdelete an Asset in Polaris\r\n\r\n**Create N channel accounts on the testnet**\r\n`python manage.py polaris-tool --action create-channel-accounts --count <count> --testnet true \r\n`\r\n**Create N channel accounts on the mainnet**\r\n`python manage.py polaris-tool --action create-channel-accounts --count <count> --distribution-seed <distribution_seed>\r\n`\r\n**Delete all channel accounts from the database**\r\n`python manage.py polaris-tool --action delete-channel-accounts\r\n`\r\n**Create an Asset in Polaris**\r\n`python manage.py polaris-tool --action create-asset --asset-name <asset_name> --issuer <issuer> --<distribution_seed>  --sep6-enabled true --deposit-enabled true \r\n`\r\n**Delete an Asset in Polaris**\r\n`python manage.py polaris-tool --action delete-asset --asset-name <asset_name>\r\n`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Polaris changes:**\r\nAdd a polaris_channel_accounts table to the database with public key and secret (encrypted) columns.\r\n\r\nCurrently, process_pending_deposits.py is the only process that submits transactions to the Stellar Network and this is the case for the foreseeable future. Because of this and for simplicity, it’s proposed that this process will read all the channel accounts into memory at startup and maintain them in memory. process_pending_deposits.py already has a locking mechanism in place that ensures only one instance of it can be running at any given time so we don’t need to worry about another instance using the same channel accounts. \r\n\r\n**Using Channel Accounts:**\r\n\r\n**Option 1: Bulk Processing**\r\nHave a task that periodically gets all transactions from the SUBMIT_TRANSACTIONS_QUEUE and create a “submit transaction” task for each one. Each task will also be assigned a channel account to use. This is more of a “polling” model and transaction processing time will be affected by the polling interval but may be better able to handle large bursts of deposit transactions. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Option 2: Pool of Executors (Preferred Option)**\r\nSpawn N “submit transaction” tasks at startup and assign a channel account to each one. The tasks will all consume from the SUBMIT_TRANSACTIONS_QUEUE (asyncio queue where transactions that are ready to be submitted are put in this queue) and block until there is data. This is an “event driven” model and will be optimal for handling a steady flow of deposit transactions but may not be suited for large bursts of deposit transactions since only N “submit transaction” tasks are spawned at startup.\r\n\r\n**Paying Transaction Fees:**\r\n\r\n**Option 1: Fund All Channel Accounts**\r\nFund all channel accounts with N lumens and have the channel accounts pay transaction fees for the transactions they submit. We will need a way to monitor and maintain the balance of the channel accounts.\r\n\r\n**Option 2: Fee-Bump (Preferred Option)**\r\nUtilize Fee-Bumps, we only need to maintain the lumens balance of one account that will be used to pay the transaction fees on behalf of the channel accounts. \r\n\r\n> “The source account of the transaction pays the fee and consumes a sequence number. You can then use one common account (your base account) to make the payment [operation](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/glossary/operations/) inside each transaction. The various channel accounts will consume their sequence numbers even though the funds are being sent from your base account.\r\n> You will, of course, have to sign the transaction with both the base account key and the channel account key.”\r\n\r\nsource: https://developers.stellar.org/docs/glossary/fee-bumps/",

For example, Polaris expects `DepositIntegration.process_sep6_request()` to raise a `ValueError` if the client's request is invalid in some way that Polaris itself cannot validate.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why this is not ideal:\r\n\r\n- Built-in exceptions could be unintentionally raised as a result of a bug in the anchor's implementation.\r\n    - Polaris may treat these exceptions as proper behavior if the raised exception is expected for a specific error case.\r\n- Polaris isn't able to disambiguate error cases that use the same built-in exception class.\r\n    - For example, if an anchor raises a `RuntimeError` from `CustodyIntegration.create_destination_account()`, it could be because the source account doesn't exist or it could be because transaction submission failed, and Polaris cannot currently determine which is the case\r\n\r\nInstead, Polaris should use custom exceptions that inherit from built-ins, just like the Python SDK does. Anchors will be required to update their implementations to raise the correct exceptions, so we'll have to wait until v3.0 to implement this for existing integrations.\r\n\r\nThat being said, we could add custom built-in exceptions for new integrations, such the `CustodyIntegration` class that currently being developed.\r\n",

Please describe.** Currently, a \"Footprint-Restoration Deadlock\" can occur when a Persistent ledger entry expires in the brief window between transaction simulation (Recording Mode) and execution (Enforcing Mode).\n\nDuring simulation, if an entry is live, the host records `AccessType::ReadOnly`. However, if that entry expires before the transaction is processed, the host’s internal logic in `handle_maybe_expired_entry` attempts to auto-restore the entry. This requires `ReadWrite` access. Since the signed footprint only contains `ReadOnly`, the transaction fails with `ScErrorCode::ExceededLimit`. While this is a rare edge case, it creates non-deterministic execution failures for valid transactions.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like** I suggest modifying the simulation logic (Recording Mode) to include a \"buffer zone\" check for Persistent entries.\n\nIf a Persistent entry is accessed and its `live_until` sequence is within a certain threshold (e.g., the next 100–500 ledgers) of the current ledger sequence, the simulation should automatically record the access as `ReadWrite` instead of `ReadOnly`.\n\n#### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n**Manual Developer Intervention:** Expecting developers to manually mark entries as ReadWrite defensively. This is inefficient and increases costs unnecessarily for the majority of the entry's lifespan.\n\n**Host-level Bypass:** Allowing the Host to bypass the `ExceededLimit` check specifically for internal TTL restoration. However, this might complicate the security invariants of the Footprint system.\n\n\n> This improvement would align simulation more closely with the realities of network latency and submission delays, ensuring that a \"successful\" simulation is more robust and predictable upon execution. It reduces the likelihood of users paying non-refundable fees for transactions that fail due to unavoidable internal maintenance logic (Rent/TTL).",

This backtrace though does not locate the original source of the error - it only locates the source of the call to `reject_error`.\r\n\r\nThe backtrace is mostly useless: the most effective way to find the actual source of the error is to read the diagnostics and hope one of them contains a greppable string. And then if you do locate the source of the error, you still don't have the backtrace that lead to that error. I almost always end up instrumenting the runtime and contracts with `println`s to actually figure out the call path to the error.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nIn some recent tests I triggered this error in `Storage::extend`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n        if old_live_until < ledger_seq {\r\n            return Err(host.err(\r\n                ScErrorType::Storage,\r\n                ScErrorCode::InternalError,\r\n                \"accessing no-longer-live entry\",\r\n                &[old_live_until.into(), ledger_seq.into()],\r\n            ));\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe end result is that I see this output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthread '<unnamed>' panicked at /home/azureuser/data/stellar/rs-soroban-env/soroban-env-host/src/host.rs:684:9:\r\nHostError: Error(Storage,

backtrace doesn't indicate where that storage error was, just that something happened during the call to the token contract.\r\n\r\nSomething interesting here is that the original error does appear to generate a backtrace that we don't get to see: it calls `Host::err`, which produces a `HostError` containing a backtrace (in `maybe_get_debug_info`):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n    pub fn err(&self, type_: ScErrorType, code: ScErrorCode, msg: &str, args: &[Val]) -> HostError {\r\n        let error = Error::from_type_and_code(type_, code);\r\n        self.error(error, msg, args)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /// At minimum constructs and returns a [HostError] build from the provided\r\n    /// [Error], and when running in [DiagnosticMode::Debug] additionally\r\n    /// records a diagnostic event with the provided `msg` and `args` and then\r\n    /// enriches the returned [Error] with [DebugInfo] in the form of a\r\n    /// [Backtrace] and snapshot of the [Events] buffer.\r\n    pub fn error(&self, error: Error, msg: &str, args: &[Val]) -> HostError {\r\n        let mut he = HostError::from(error);\r\n        self.with_debug_mode(|| {\r\n            // We _try_ to take a mutable borrow of the events buffer refcell\r\n            // while building up the event we're going to emit into the events\r\n            // log, failing gracefully (just emitting a no-debug-info\r\n            // `HostError` wrapping the supplied `Error`) if we cannot acquire\r\n            // the refcell. This is to handle the \"double fault\" case where we\r\n            // get an error _while performing_ any of the steps needed to record\r\n            // an error as an event, below.\r\n            if let Ok(mut events_refmut) = self.0.events.try_borrow_mut() {\r\n                self.record_err_diagnostics(events_refmut.deref_mut(), error, msg, args);\r\n            }\r\n            he = HostError {\r\n                error,\r\n                info: self.maybe_get_debug_info(),\r\n            };\r\n            Ok(())\r\n        });\r\n        he\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis `HostError` is not the one that ultimately gets printed. Instead, `escalate_error_to_panic` creates a _new_ `HostError` and prints that:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n    #[cfg(feature = \"testutils\")]\r\n    fn escalate_error_to_panic(&self, e: Self::Error) -> ! {\r\n        let _ = self.with_current_frame_opt(|f| {\r\n            if let Some(Frame::TestContract(frame)) = f {\r\n                if let Ok(mut panic) = frame.panic.try_borrow_mut() {\r\n                    *panic = Some(e.error);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            Ok(())\r\n        });\r\n        // XXX discard a HostError and create a new one to panic/print XXX\r\n        let escalation = self.error(e.error, \"escalating error to panic\", &[]);\r\n        panic!(\"{:#?}\", escalation);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis new `HostError` generates the useless backtrace.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt's not obvious though how to thread the backtrace from the original error all the way to this `escalate_error_to_panic` function (the `HostError` received as input to this function is _still_ not the original error, as the errors go through multiple layers of possibly-lossy translation from `HostError` to `ScError` and back; reusing the input `HostError`s backtrace would be more useful than the one that is printed though, and in some cases may be the actual desired backtrace).\r\n\r\nAt the time the original error is generated, diagnostics are also logged, so there's an opportunity there to stash a backtrace in the diagnostics; then (somehow) figure out that particular diagnostic contains the backtrace of interest.",

LTO doesn't strip them entirely. And worst of all, those panic strings have pathnames in them. This leads to:\r\n  - A bit of a security issue, as contracts will contain the home directory name of their developer or whatever.\r\n  - A bit of needless churn, as contract bytes become less deterministic, every rebuild from some different directory (CI, a user's workstation, whatever) likely changes a constant so rearranges the data segment and changes all the byte offsets.\r\n\r\nWe can _kinda_ work around this with [`--remap-path-prefix`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/command-line-arguments.html#--remap-path-prefix-remap-source-names-in-output) but it's quite awkward to use -- you have to know the path you're replacing exactly, which isn't the easiest thing to figure out in a build script -- and the better option [`trim-paths`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/111540) appears to also require nightly / is currently unstable.\r\n\r\nNot sure what the best thing to do is here at this point, maybe figure out a good idiom for `--remap-path-prefix`, but I figured I'd at least make a note. cc @C0x41lch0x41 as I imagine you might (a) want to know (b) have opinions about how serious the security issue here is.",

Thanks! -->\r\n\r\n### What problem does your feature solve?\r\n\r\nSoroban's fuzzing support is all located in the soroban-sdk crate, end-user focused. It could be desirable for internal testing purposes to have that support in the soroban-env-host crate, or even soroban-env-common, with implementations of SorobanArbitrary for the internal types used by the host but not exposed through the SDK.\r\n\r\n### What would you like to see?\r\n\r\nExtract most of soroban_sdk::arbitrary to soroban_env_host::arbitrary (or soroban_env_common::arbitrary), and reexport from the SDK.\r\n\r\nThe big complication is that the main SorobanArbitrary type is defined in terms of the Env struct that is defined in the SDK, so not suitable as-is for use in the env crates. It may not be possible to simply move it.\r\n\r\n### What alternatives are there?\r\n\r\nThe main desire I think is probably to write proptests for the env crates, and the Arbitrary trait is not strictly necessary for proptests, and using it as intermediary for proptests may even result in lower quality input than just using the proptest traits directly.\r\n\r\nIt might be desirable to instead write proptest adapters directly, in a similar way to the SorobanArbitrary prototype.\r\n\r\ncc @graydon \r\n",

They can probably all just reuse a single definition of the test linear memory pattern -- computed once during wasm synthesis and stored into the wasm as a data section -- rather than imperatively rewriting the contents of linear memory when they run. This is partly a speed issue, partly an issue around \"it'd be nice to exercise the data section code paths of wasmi\", and partly a simplification issue: if you calculate the LM during synthesis it's a little easier to dump out for inspection.\r\n2. They probably don't need to be macro-generated? This I'm less certain about -- and it might still benefit from something macro-like such as the `crossroads` crate for factoring -- but I _think_ the variation-between-tests ought not to be much larger than a couple lines each, and I think writing all those short tests in aggregate might not be much more code than this macro code, and would certainly be easier to understand, run individual tests of, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is a low-priority code-cleanup bug, not anything especially urgent.",

      "body": "When using `stellar-wallets-kit v2 (jsr:2.0.0-beta.6)` in a Next.js application, a React hydration error occurs because the library modifies the <html> tag's inline styles during client-side initialization, causing a mismatch between server-rendered HTML and client-rendered HTML.\nError Message\n\n<img width=\"447\" height=\"164\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f61b9eb-763b-4608-b2a6-27f864dc74bf\" />\n<img width=\"449\" height=\"740\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8a83bf9-4c5b-424b-ac4d-0129924c196c\" />\n\nA tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up.\n\n### Root Cause\nIn [state/effects.ts](https://github.com/Creit-Tech/Stellar-Wallets-Kit/blob/main/src/state/effects.ts#L8-L14) (lines 8-14), the library uses a Preact signal effect that automatically applies theme CSS custom properties directly to document.documentElement.style:\n\n```\nexport const updatedThemeEffect: () => void = effect((): void => {\n  if (document) {\n    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(theme.value)) {\n      document.documentElement.style.setProperty(`--swk-${key}`, value);\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis effect is registered at module load time and fires immediately when StellarWalletsKit.init() is called with theme configuration.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a Next.js app with SSR enabled\n2. Install jsr:@creit-tech/stellar-wallets-kit@2.0.0-beta.6\n3. Initialize the kit in a client component:\n\n```\nuseEffect(() => {\n  if (!isClient) return;\n  \n  StellarWalletsKit.init({\n    network: networkType,\n    modules: defaultModules(),\n    theme: myTheme, // Any theme object\n  });\n}, [isClient]);\n```\n\nLoad the page and observe hydration error in console\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe library should apply theme styles in a way that's compatible with SSR frameworks like Next.js, avoiding modifications to the <html> tag's inline styles that cause hydration mismatches.\n\n### Suggested Solutions\n\nUse a <style> tag instead of inline styles - Inject CSS custom properties via a style tag in the document head\nUse class-based theming - Apply theme classes instead of inline CSS variables\n\n### Workaround\n\nCurrently, users need to suppress hydration warnings on the <html> tag:\n\n`<html lang=\"en\" suppressHydrationWarning>`\n\nHowever, this is not ideal as it suppresses all hydration warnings, not just the ones from the wallet kit.\n\n### Environment\n\nPackage: `jsr:@creit-tech/stellar-wallets-kit@2.0.0-beta.6`\nFramework: Next.js 15.5.3\nReact: 19.1.1",

      "body": "This is going to require some work with the full set of wallets y'all interface with, but it solves a BIG problem.\n\nToday, SWK is extremely hard to use (at least, with standard app building patterns) because `getAddress` is overloaded. It currently does three, maybe four, things:\n\n1. Checks if the user has opened the wallet and given it permission to access the current app. Freighter has two methods for this same behavior, and both are useful:\n   * [isConnected](https://docs.freighter.app/docs/playground/isConnected)\n   * [isAllowed](https://docs.freighter.app/docs/playground/isAllowed)\n2. It **OPENS THE WALLET EXTENSION'S \"CONNECT\" MODAL!!** I'm going to shout about this some more because it is SO unexpected and leads to horrible twisty app logic. In general, a getter method should NEVER HAVE SIDE EFFECTS. If something has a name that indicates that it's doing a simple data look-up, it should not also do something as obnoxious or user-effecting as opening a modal.\n   * In Freighter, this is done with [requestAccess](https://docs.freighter.app/docs/playground/requestAccess), an action-verb name that gives the developer a hint at its repercussions.\n3. It actually gets the currently-selected address from the connected wallet\n\nSince SWK currently provides no way to do this, apps today need to implement some impoverished version of `1` above using localStorage. In Scaffold Stellar today, we use `localStorage`. There's all sorts of side effects we need to code around, or simply _can't_ or _shouldn't_ code around:\n\n* [Our `onWalletSelected` logic](https://github.com/AhaLabs/scaffold-stellar-frontend/blob/391fdef0ef9114d4b82096eb38369ceebd04a46e/src/util/wallet.ts#L31-L42) only sets `localStorage` after a successful subsequent call to `getAddress`, because without that our polling logic starts requesting `getAddress` and opening duplicate \"connect\" modals.\n* If the user connects on Day 1, the localStorage will still be set on Day 2, which will cause `getAddress` to be called at page load, opening the \"connect\" modal. Perhaps the only way around this is to reverse-engineer specific wallet extensions' session expiration logic, and implement more app-side logic to [expire this `localStorage`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4275854/249801). This is error-prone and bloated.\n* Rather than straightforwardly asking _the wallet extension itself_ if the user `isConnected` and if the extension `isAllowed` to access the page, we need to [check if our localStorage item is set](https://github.com/AhaLabs/scaffold-stellar-frontend/blob/391fdef0ef9114d4b82096eb38369ceebd04a46e/src/providers/WalletProvider.tsx#L29-L38). As noted, this is not the same thing, and leads to hard-to-maintain code and janky user experiences.\n\nI suggest following Freighter's lead here, adding `isConnected`, `isAllowed`, and `requestAccess`.\n\nI realize that I am suggesting interface methods beyond what is specified by [SEP-43](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0043.md). To me, the challenge of using bare-minimum, current-day SEP-43 indicates to me that it is too limited, and we need to update it. SWK ought to be the most powerful voice in this process.",

Today, apps themselves all need to individually implement polling logic. In Scaffold Stellar, we do this polling [every single second](https://github.com/AhaLabs/scaffold-stellar-frontend/blob/391fdef0ef9114d4b82096eb38369ceebd04a46e/src/providers/WalletProvider.tsx#L69-L87).\n\nThere's a lot to get right, and a lot one could get wrong, with this sort of polling logic. If you click on the above link, you'll see that we put this logic in a Provider, which means it only happens once app-wide, rather than in a simpler hook that could cause the same every-second check to be fired from multiple parts of the app at once. We also took care with our `await` logic, using a `while (true)` rather than `setInterval` so that one run of the loop finishes before the next starts. Finally, we return a function from our `useEffect` that stops awaiting completion of the next loop run.\n\nIt would be much nicer to follow Freighter's lead and allow a subscription-based workflow. \n\nI realize that this exceeds the interface specified in [SEP-43](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0043.md). SWK can be a powerful voice in the ecosystem for evolving SEP-43, and subscriptions are a good reason to do so.",

These can be the `*_ID` strings that are currently used to set `selectedWalletId`.\n2. Stop exporting all the `*Module`s altogether, as they seem like an implementation detail that leaked.\n3.

To disambiguate users who use pooled accounts, we're moving forward with a memo-based approach, where a given user is identified by the shared Stellar account AND a memo (or user id). We are currently updating our SEPs to integrate this mechanism, and would like the demo wallet to support  users with this type of account.\r\n\r\nYou can see the changes being made to the protocols (10, 24, 31, 6, 12) here: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/pull/1036\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nGenerally, we need to give users of the demo wallet the ability to provide an account ID or memo after adding a Stellar account. This memo should then be used in accordance with the SEPs in all interactions with anchor applications.\r\n\r\nUI:\r\n- allow users to enter a memo to be used after or while adding a Stellar account\r\n- allow users to modify the memo used\r\n\r\nSEP-10:\r\n- passing the memo and type in the `GET WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT` call\r\n\r\nSEP-24:\r\n- allow users to include the memo in `POST /transactions/interactive/deposit` requests, or provide a custom memo\r\n    - Applications using custodial accounts may provide per-account or per-transaction memos to use when sending funds\r\n\r\nSEP-6:\r\n- same as SEP-24\r\n\r\nSEP-31:\r\n- If a memo has been entered, confirm that the memo should be associated with the sending user of the transaction\r\n    - Since the Stellar account in a SEP-31 transaction belongs to the sending anchor, the memo ID must be for the sending customer, otherwise it doesn't make sense\r\n- pass the memo and type when calling `GET /customer` and `PUT /customer` for the  sending customer\r\n- while we're at it, we might as well allow users to provide a memo to use for the receiving customer, but this should not be saved outside of the SEP-31 flow",

We should not do it like the anchor platform that limits the external signature just to Fireblocks!\n\nSince the SDP is already using Kafka, adding transactions to be signed to a queue, wait for the signature, get them signed and then put it to a queue to be submitted should not be a problem.\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\nNone that I know of.\n",

To enable that functionality, do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Use useSort hook (in `/hooks/useSort`) to `get/set` `sortBy`, `sortDir`, and `handleSort` by passing in the method that handles the sorting (update state parameter in TanStack Query in this case).\r\n2. Add the following to the `Table.HeaderCell` component:\r\na. `sortDirection` property is used to set the sorting direction.\r\nb. `onSort` method triggers the sorting using handleSort method from the `useSort` hook (passing in the field ID to sort by).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\n// Keep track of sortBy field and direction in component state\r\n\r\nconst onSort = () => {\r\n  // Set/reset sortBy field and direction\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst { sortBy, sortDir, handleSort } = useSort(onSort);\r\n\r\n<Table.HeaderCell\r\n  sortDirection={sortBy === \"name\" ? sortDir : \"default\"}\r\n  onSort={() => handleSort(\"name\")}\r\n>\r\n  Column name\r\n</Table.HeaderCell>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorking implementation in `/components/DisbursementsTable.tsx`.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nIf sorting is enabled on a table column, up and down arrows will be displayed next to the column name. Clicking once on the column will sort in ascending order (the up arrow will be highlighted). Clicking a second time on the same column will sort in descending order (the down arrow will be highlighted). Clicking the third time will clear the sorting. API call should be called every time the sorting field or order is changed, as all the sorting is done on the server.

If business doesn't call RPC, transaction status [is not updated appropriately](https://github.com/philipliu/java-stellar-anchor-sdk/blob/2e90acc85f770e4b91ff985ae939a20a20c842df/core/src/main/java/org/stellar/anchor/sep12/Sep12Service.java#L109-L125).\r\nWe make a callback to wallet both in RPC and in `PUT /customer` that leads to duplicate update on the wallet size.\r\nSecond, according to the SEP-12 spec, we should only send callbacks when status has been changed. Currently, we send callback on any `PUT` request and any RPC call (that is also done as part of `PUT` request handling).\r\n\r\n### Business server `PUT` callback proposal change\r\nWe propose to change `PUT` callback for the business server. It should now return full Customer body response. This will allow us to not require business to call RPC on sync updates anymore. Instead, we can perform the same logic in `PUT` handler (update transaction status) \r\nSecond, we should add a new required boolean field to Business Server `PUT` callback response (`status_updated`). When set to `true`, we will fire an customer status change event. If set to `false`, nothing happens. \r\nIn return, as RPC is used to sync updates, we should always fire customer status change events (the way it's done now)",

      "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nTo support onchain-onchain deposits and withdrawals in SEP-6 and SEP-24, we propose extending the existing exchange functionality. Currently, SEP-6 and SEP-24 limit `source_asset` (for deposits) and `destination_asset` (for withdrawals) to ISO 4217 assets, which aligns with the typical on-ramp/off-ramp use case. However, this restriction is not a fundamental requirement for deposits or withdrawals.\r\n\r\nSEP-38 will be utilized to provide quotes for onchain-onchain transactions. The protocol (SEP-38) does not inherently restrict one of the assets to be an off-chain asset, so no changes are needed in the protocol itself.\r\n\r\nOn the Anchor Platform side, updates will be made to the RPCs and SEP (SEP-6 and SEP-24) transaction creation to relax some validations on `source_asset` and `destination_asset`. The `RequestOnchainFunds` RPC will be updated to handle both deposits and withdrawals for onchain-onchain transactions. These changes can be implemented in a non-breaking manner, allowing them to be included in version 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Protocol Changes\r\n#### SEP-6 Deposit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n- `source_asset` can now be a Stellar asset.\r\n- SEP-9 supports crypto account fields, which will be used to return deposit information to the client.\r\n\r\nRequest (deposit USDC for SRT):\r\n`GET [TRANSFER_SERVER]/deposit-exchange?source_asset=stellar:USDC:G...&destination_asset=SRT&...&type=stellar`\r\n\r\n`GET /transaction` or `GET /deposit-exchange` Response:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"instructions\": {\r\n    \"organization.crypto_address\": {\r\n      \"value\": \"G...\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Anchor generated deposit address\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"organization.bank_account_number\": {\r\n      \"value\": \"13719713158835300\",\r\n      \"description\": \"Anchor generated deposit text memo\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"how\": \"Send 10 USDC to the address G... with 13719713158835300 as the text memo\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n##### Alternative Approach\r\n\r\nWe could include `withdraw_anchor_account`, `withdraw_memo`, and `withdraw_memo_type` in the response. This provides a structured response that wallets can easily parse, but it requires wallet support for implementation.\r\n##### Considerations\r\n\r\nReusing the `instructions` field is lightweight and does not require wallet implementation for onchain-onchain deposits. However, the user experience (UX) may be awkward. Users, already in the wallet, would need to copy the deposit information, exit the deposit flow UI, and submit a transaction to the Anchor's deposit address.\r\n\r\nTo improve UX, we can define standard values/descriptions when the `crypto_address` is a Stellar account, allowing wallets to easily parse this information and create the transaction programmatically. However, if we are considering this, then `withdraw_anchor_account` approach is preferable.\r\n#### SEP-6 Withdraw\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n- `destination_asset` can be a Stellar asset.\r\n\r\nRequest (withdraw SRT to USDC):\r\n`GET [TRANSFER_SERVER]/withdraw-exchange?source_asset=SRT&destination_asset=stellar:USDC:G...&`\r\n\r\n`GET /transaction` Response:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"withdraw_anchor_account\": \"G...\",\r\n  \"withdraw_memo\": \"13719713158835300\",\r\n  \"withdraw_memo_type\": \"text\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr in the `GET /withdraw-exchange` response if it can be provided synchronously:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"account_id\": \"G...\",\r\n  \"memo\": \"13719713158835300\",\r\n  \"memo_type\": \"text\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### SEP-24 Deposit\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n - `source_asset` can be a Stellar asset.\r\n\r\nRequest (deposit USDC for SRT):\r\n`POST [TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024]/transactions/deposit/interactive`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"asset_code\": \"SRT\",\r\n  \"issuer\": \"G...\",\r\n  \"source_asset\": \"stellar:USDC:G...\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\nInteractive URL link with the deposit instructions on the web page.\r\n\r\n#### SEP-24 Withdraw\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n- `destination_asset` can be a Stellar asset.\r\n\r\nRequest (withdraw SRT to USDC):\r\n`POST [TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024]/transactions/withdraw/interactive`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"asset_code\": \"SRT\",\r\n  \"issuer\": \"G...\",\r\n  \"destination_asset\": \"stellar:USDC:G...\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\nInteractive URL link with the deposit instructions on the web page.\r\n\r\n### Anchor Platform Changes\r\n\r\n#### RPC\r\n\r\nThe `RequestOnchainFunds` RPC is currently called by the business server during the withdraw (exchange) flows. Moving forward, the business server will also call this RPC for exchange transactions where both assets are Stellar assets, meaning it will be used in both `deposit` and `withdraw` flows. The RPC currently validates that the `amount_out.asset` is not a Stellar asset. This validation will be updated to allow `amount_out.asset` to be a Stellar asset for exchange transactions.\r\n\r\n#### Config\r\n\r\nUsing SRT as an example, if USDC <-> SRT is supported and if a business also wants to support USD <-> SRT, there is no need to change the asset config schema. The asset config should include `USDC` and `SRT` with deposit/withdraw enabled, and the counter asset correctly set in the `sep38.exchangable_assets` list.\r\n\r\nIf USD <-> SRT should not be supported, a new field called `swap_only` can be added under the `deposit`/`withdraw` operations. Enabling `swap_only` would disable USD <-> SRT transactions.",

Compute chunk_id and local_index from sequence\n\n2. Open index file, read header (version, offset_size)\n\n3. Read two adjacent offsets from index using pread:\n   entry_pos = 8 + local_index * offset_size\n   pread(index_file, offset_size * 2, entry_pos)\n   Parse: start_offset, end_offset\n\n4. Close index file\n\n5. Compute record size:\n   record_size = end_offset - start_offset\n\n6. Open data file, read compressed record using pread:\n   compressed = pread(data_file, record_size, start_offset)\n\n7. Close data file\n\n8. Decompress:\n   ledger = zstd_decompress(compressed)\n\n9. Return ledger\n```\n\n### Write: Append\n\nWhen appending a ledger:\n1. Compute the chunk_id and local_index from the next sequence number\n2. If starting a new chunk, create the parent directory if needed and create an empty data file\n3. Compress the ledger with zstd and append to the data file\n4. Track the offset in memory\n5. When the chunk is full, determine offset_size based on final data file size, then write the index file\n\n## Limits\n\n| Limit | Value | Rationale |\n|-------|-------|-----------|\n| Min sequence | 2 | Stellar ledger numbering |\n| Max sequence | 2^32 - 1 (~4.29 billion) | u32 sequence |\n| Max chunk data (4-byte offset) | 4 GB | u32 offset |\n| Max chunk data (8-byte offset) | 2^64 bytes | u64 offset |\n| Max chunks | ~429,497 | Derived from max sequence with chunk_size=10000 |\n| Max files per directory | 2000 | 1000 chunks × 2 files |\n| Max subdirectories | 430 | At u32 max with chunk_size=10000 |\n\n## Benchmark Metrics\n\nThe following metrics should be collected when comparing against alternative implementations:\n\n**Latency:**\n- Point lookup p50, p99, p999\n\n**Throughput:**\n- Writes per second\n- Ingestion time\n\n**Disk space:**\n- Total storage size (data + index files)\n\n**Memory usage:**\n- Peak memory usage\n- Steady-state memory usage\n\n## Recommended Go Libraries\n\n| Purpose | Library |\n|---------|---------|\n| Zstd | `github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd` |\n| pread | `os.File.ReadAt()` (standard library) |\n| Binary encoding | `encoding/binary` (standard library) |\n\n\n## Versioning\n\nFormat changes require incrementing version in index header. Readers must reject unknown versions.\n\n| Version | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| 1 | Initial format (this spec) |\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\nThe following optimizations could be added in future iterations but are not necessary for this POC:\n\n### Index Caching\n\nCache index file contents in memory using an LRU cache to avoid repeated file I/O for frequently accessed chunks.\n\n- **Use case**: Workloads with temporal locality (e.g., recent ledgers accessed more frequently)\n- **Trade-off**: Memory usage vs read latency\n- **Implementation**: LRU cache keyed by chunk_id, storing parsed index offsets (~40 KB per chunk with 4-byte offsets)\n- **Recommended library**: `github.com/hashicorp/golang-lru/v2`\n\n### Ledger Range Queries\n\nSupport efficient retrieval of consecutive ledgers.\n\n- **Use case**: Batch processing, historical analysis, replication\n- **Implementation**: \n  - Read start and end offsets from index\n  - Single pread for contiguous compressed data block\n  - Sequential decompression of records\n- **API**: `GET_RANGE(start_seq, end_seq) -> iterator<bytes>`\n\n### File Descriptor Caching\n\nKeep file descriptors open for recently accessed chunks to avoid open/close overhead.\n\n- **Use case**: High-throughput random access patterns\n- **Trade-off**: File descriptor usage vs syscall overhead (~2-4 μs per open/close)\n- **Implementation**: LRU cache of open file descriptors with eviction callback to close files\n",

However, we don't have any tools that can do something similar on the user-request volume side. Even omitting concerns around load, our release process for RPC is lacking any real-world-like traffic validation (as we have for Horizon), being that we don't run a pubnet RPC internally and therefore don't have much/any traffic to mirror in order to gain confidence.  \n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nThis issue should probably transform into an epic as however we decide to do this will likely end up being a lot of work. Work would include:\n- Client Load generation/simulation tool that can be run against RPC (it's probably fine to limit this to read-only traffic)\n   - [ ] https://github.com/stellar/stellar-rpc/issues/569\n- Assessment of existing RPC observability/metrics/dashboard and augmenting it with any additional metrics needed to accurate assess functional or non-functional performance degradations under different client request loads\n  - [ ] https://github.com/stellar/stellar-rpc/issues/574 \n- Integrating this tool into our release process in some way. More automation is preferred here, so while manually running it during a release process would probably be acceptable, it might be nice to have it constantly running against the prod dev environment over time, so that we can catch changes across deployments\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\nNot necessarily alternatives, but some other niceties/add-ons that we may want to consider as part of this:\n- Migrating to true continuous deployment for RPC (potentially using ArgoCD Rollouts), and setup automated rollbacks/promotions based on changes in key metric values (assuming constant traffic from load testing tool hitting the deployments)\n- Open-sourcing/productionalizing the tool, such that RPC providers or operators could use it to test their own deployments and know when they might need to horizontally scale their setups\n- Deploying a separate/dedicated instance of RPC specifically for load-testing, independent of our current dev cluster. Perhaps this is just repurposing/renaming the new io2 instance we just spun up",

If `rocksdb.enabled = false`, skip all RocksDB initialization\n2. If `rocksdb.enabled = true` but `rocksdb.fullHistory.getLedgers = false`, skip ledger store initialization\n3. If `rocksdb.fullHistory.getLedgers = true`:\n   - Exactly one of `storePaths` or `stores` must be specified (not both, not neither)\n   - All specified paths must exist and be accessible\n   - For `storePaths`: auto-discover subdirectories matching pattern `year-*`\n   - For `stores`: each path must be a valid RocksDB database\n4. `blockCacheSizeMB` must be > 0\n5. `bloomFilterBits` must be >= 0 (0 disables bloom filters)\n\n\n### Directory Structure Examples\n\n**Option 1: Top-level paths with auto-discovery**\n```\n/mnt/nvme1/rocksdb-stores/\n├── year-2015/\n│   ├── CURRENT\n│   ├──

`storePaths`: scans each directory for `year-*` subdirectories\n  - For `stores`: validates each path exists\n  - Returns deduplicated list of store paths\n- [ ] Add `RocksDBConfig` to main configuration struct\n- [ ] Add configuration documentation to example TOML file\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n- Configuration loads correctly from TOML\n- Validation catches all error cases (both options specified, neither specified, invalid paths)\n- Auto-discovery finds all `year-*` directories\n- Clear error messages for configuration problems\n\n---\n\n### Task 2: Core RocksDBLedgerStoreReader Implementation\n\n**_Use [this](https://github.com/karthikiyer56/stellar-full-history-ingestion/blob/ccf881008061839ff2fbea70f50f9a62c2a5a8cf/rocksdb/recsplit/benchmarking/recsplit_rocksdb_query_benchmark.go#L479-L495) as reference for implementation_**\n\n**File**: `internal/ledgerstore/rocksdb_reader.go`\n\n- [ ] Implement `rocksDBLedgerStoreReader` struct with:\n  - Slice of `*RocksDBStore` (individual store wrappers)\n  - Shared `*grocksdb.Cache` for block cache\n  - Shared `*grocksdb.ReadOptions`\n  - Shared `*grocksdb.Options`\n  - `sync.RWMutex` for thread-safe store management\n  - Pre-built ledger range index for O(1) store lookup\n  - Initialization state flag\n\n- [ ] Implement `RocksDBStore` struct (per-store wrapper):\n```go\n  type RocksDBStore struct {\n      DB        *grocksdb.DB\n      Path      string\n      Name      string\n      MinLedger uint32\n      MaxLedger uint32\n  }\n```\n\n- [ ] Implement `Initialize(ctx context.Context) error`:\n  - Create shared LRU block cache with configured size\n  - Create shared BlockBasedTableOptions with bloom filter\n  - Create shared Options with table options\n  - Create shared ReadOptions\n  - Open each store in read-only mode\n  - For each store, call `SeekToFirst()` and `SeekToLast()` to determine ledger range\n  - Validate no overlapping ranges\n  - Sort stores by MinLedger for efficient lookup\n  - Log initialization summary (store count, total ledger range, cache size)\n\n- [ ] Implement `Close() error`:\n  - Close all RocksDB database handles\n  - Destroy ReadOptions, Options, BlockBasedTableOptions\n  - Release block cache\n  - Log shutdown\n\n- [ ] Implement `findStoreForLedger(ledgerSeq uint32) *RocksDBStore`:\n  - O(n) scan through sorted stores checking range\n  - Could optimize to O(log n) with binary search if needed\n  - Returns nil if not found\n\n- [ ] Implement helper `decompressAndUnmarshal(data []byte) (xdr.LedgerCloseMeta, error)`:\n  - Create zstd decoder (consider pooling for performance)\n  - Decompress data\n  - Unmarshal XDR to LedgerCloseMeta\n  - Return result\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n- All stores open successfully with shared cache\n- Ledger ranges correctly determined at startup\n- Thread-safe initialization (only once)\n- Clean shutdown releases all resources\n\n---\n\n### Task 3: Ledger Retrieval Methods\n\n**File**: `internal/ledgerstore/rocksdb_reader.go` (continued)\n\n- [ ] Implement `GetLedger(ctx context.Context, ledgerSeq uint32) (xdr.LedgerCloseMeta, error)`:\n  - Check initialization state\n  - Find store for ledger using range index\n  - If no store found, return `ErrLedgerNotFound`\n  - Encode ledgerSeq as 4-byte big-endian key\n  - Query RocksDB\n  - If key not found, return `ErrLedgerNotFound`\n  - Decompress and unmarshal\n  - Return LedgerCloseMeta\n\n- [ ] Implement `GetLedgerRange(ctx context.Context, startSeq, endSeq uint32) ([]xdr.LedgerCloseMeta, error)`:\n  - Validate startSeq <= endSeq\n  - Pre-allocate result slice\n  - Iterate from startSeq to endSeq\n  - For each ledger, call GetLedger (or optimize with iterator if same store)\n  - Stop on first error/missing ledger\n  - Return collected ledgers\n\n- [ ] Implement `GetRawLedger(ctx context.Context, ledgerSeq uint32) ([]byte, error)`:\n  - Same as GetLedger but skip decompression/unmarshal\n  - Return raw compressed bytes\n  - Useful for streaming/proxying\n\n- [ ] Implement `HasLedger(ledgerSeq uint32) bool`:\n  - Check if ledgerSeq falls within any store's range\n  - O(1) using pre-built range index\n  - Does NOT query RocksDB (range check only)\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n- GetLedger returns correct data for existing ledgers\n- GetLedger returns ErrLedgerNotFound for non-existent ledgers\n- GetLedgerRange handles cross-store ranges correctly\n- HasLedger is fast (no disk I/O)\n- Context cancellation is respected\n\n---\n\n### Task 4: Store Management Methods\n\n**File**: `internal/ledgerstore/rocksdb_reader.go` (continued)\n\n- [ ] Implement `GetStoreInfo() []StoreInfo`:\n  - Return metadata for all loaded stores\n  - Include path, name, ledger range, size\n\n- [ ] Implement `GetTotalLedgerRange() LedgerRange`:\n  - Return min of all MinLedgers, max of all MaxLedgers\n\n- [ ] Implement `AddStore(ctx context.Context, path string) error`:\n  - Acquire write lock\n  - Open new store in read-only mode\n  - Determine ledger range\n  - Check for overlap with existing stores\n  - If overlap, close new store and return error\n  - Add to store list\n  - Re-sort stores by MinLedger\n  - Release lock\n\n- [ ] Implement `RemoveStore(path string) error`:\n  - Acquire write lock\n  - Find store by path or name\n  - If not found, return error\n  - Close the store\n  - Remove from store list\n  - Release lock\n\n- [ ] Implement `Health(ctx context.Context) HealthStatus`:\n  - Check each store is accessible (simple key lookup)\n  - Return aggregate health status\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n- AddStore correctly validates no overlap\n- RemoveStore correctly releases resources\n- Operations are thread-safe\n- Health check is fast and accurate\n\n---\n\n### Task 5: Factory Function and Dependency Injection\n\n**File**: `internal/ledgerstore/factory.go`\n\n- [ ] Implement factory function:\n```go\n  func NewRocksDBLedgerStoreReader(config RocksDBFullHistoryConfig) (RocksDBLedgerStoreReader, error) {\n      // Validate config\n      // Discover stores from storePaths or use explicit stores\n      // Create reader instance\n      // Return (reader, nil) - caller must call Initialize()\n  }\n```\n\n- [ ] Implement conditional initialization in RPC service startup:\n```go\n  func initializeLedgerStore(cfg *config.Config) (RocksDBLedgerStoreReader, error) {\n      if !cfg.RocksDB.Enabled {\n          return nil, nil // RocksDB disabled\n      }\n      \n      if !cfg.RocksDB.FullHistory.GetLedgers {\n          return nil, nil // getLedgers disabled\n      }\n      \n      reader, err := NewRocksDBLedgerStoreReader(cfg.RocksDB.FullHistory)\n      if err != nil {\n          return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to create ledger store reader: %w\", err)\n      }\n      \n      if err := reader.Initialize(context.Background()); err != nil {\n          return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to initialize ledger store reader: %w\", err)\n      }\n      \n      return reader, nil\n  }\n```\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n- Factory correctly handles all configuration scenarios\n- Disabled configurations return nil without error\n- Initialization errors are properly propagated\n- Clean integration with RPC service startup\n\n---\n\n### Task 6: Integration with RPC Service\n\n**File**: `cmd/soroban-rpc/internal/methods/get_ledger.go` (or similar)\n\n- [ ] Add `RocksDBLedgerStoreReader` to RPC handler dependencies\n- [ ] Modify `getLedger` handler to:\n  - First check if ledger is in primary store (existing behavior)\n  - If not found AND RocksDB reader is available, query RocksDB\n  - Return appropriate response\n\n- [ ] Add graceful shutdown:\n  - Call `reader.Close()` on service shutdown\n\n- [ ] Add health check endpoint integration:\n  - Include RocksDB store health in `/health` endpoint\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n- getLedger seamlessly falls back to RocksDB for historical ledgers\n- No change in behavior when RocksDB is disabled\n- Health endpoint reports RocksDB status\n- Graceful shutdown closes all stores\n\n---\n\n### Task 7: Logging and Metrics\n\n**File**: Various\n\n- [ ] Add structured logging for:\n  - Store initialization (path, ledger range, size)\n  - Store addition/removal\n  - Lookup failures (ledger not found)\n  - Errors (decompression, unmarshal, RocksDB errors)\n\n- [ ] Add metrics for:\n  - `rocksdb_ledger_lookups_total` (counter, labels: store, status)\n  - `rocksdb_ledger_lookup_duration_seconds` (histogram, labels: store)\n  - `rocksdb_stores_total` (gauge)\n  - `rocksdb_block_cache_hit_ratio` (gauge, from RocksDB stats)\n  - `rocksdb_total_ledger_range` (gauge, min and max labels)\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n- All significant operations are logged\n- Metrics are exposed in Prometheus format\n- Log levels are appropriate (info for startup, debug for lookups, error for failures)\n\n---\n\n### Task 8: Testing\n\n**File**: `internal/ledgerstore/rocksdb_reader_test.go`\n\n- [ ] Unit tests for configuration validation\n- [ ] Unit tests for store discovery (mock filesystem)\n- [ ] Integration tests with real RocksDB stores:\n  - Initialize with single store\n  - Initialize with multiple stores\n  - GetLedger for existing ledger\n  - GetLedger for non-existent ledger\n  - GetLedgerRange within single store\n  - GetLedgerRange spanning multiple stores\n  - HasLedger for various cases\n  - AddStore with valid store\n  - AddStore with overlapping range (should fail)\n  - RemoveStore\n  - Concurrent access (multiple goroutines calling GetLedger)\n\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- `github.com/linxGnu/grocksdb` - RocksDB Go bindings\n\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n1. **Shared Block Cache**: All stores share a single LRU cache to maximize hit rate\n2. **Read-Only Mode**: Stores opened in read-only mode (no write locks, better concurrency)\n3. **Zstd Decoder Pooling**: Consider pooling decoders to reduce allocation overhead\n4. **Range Index**: Pre-built at startup for O(1) store selection\n5. **Bloom Filters**: 10-bit bloom filters reduce disk reads for non-existent keys\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- RocksDB store generation/ingestion (separate ticket)\n- Store compaction/maintenance\n- Replication/backup\n\n\n\n## Final Checklist\n\n- [ ] Task 1: Configuration Parsing and Validation\n-

Namely, large on-disk storage size vs external storage mechanism. Managing large on-disk storage is decidedly painful, but infrastructure providers have proved very resistant in the past to architectures which are not self-contained nodes (ie. db on-disk). \n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nGiven the constraint that we _must_ have a fully embedded database, perform a spike/benchmarking of what that would look like from a resources + cost + response time perspective. We should do this for both the txhash->seq and txhash->tx case. Document findings extensively. This will provide us a more tangible \"upper bound\" on what such a solution would look like, but we should also try to extrapolate what it may be for the higher TPS goals.\n\n\n### getTransactionByHash\n\n- [ ] MDBX conclusions\n- [ ] RocksDB conclusions",

Some recent examples:\n- https://github.com/stellar/stellar-rpc/issues/402\n- https://github.com/stellar/stellar-rpc/issues/389\n- https://github.com/stellar/stellar-rpc/issues/358\n- https://github.com/stellar/stellar-rpc/issues/418\n\nAdditional ones we recently identified but that are not captured in issues:\n- Inability to filter `getEvents` by transaction hash or transaction id (alternatively, `events` as a top-level field on `getTransactions`/`getTransaction`)\n- Possibility of RPC returning an empty page due to sparse events, but the client should still be able to page forward and may get more events\n- `endLedger` in the paging queries is completely unused/ignored, leading to the inability for a client to get all the things in a single ledger\n- `cursor` values produced by RPC can send you beyond RPC's retention window (into the future)\n- No ability to stream; websockets, sse, or otherwise\n- json-rpc << rest\n\nAdd onto this, that events are likely to get significantly more focus now that CAP-67 and unified events are on the horizon for protocol 23. \n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nWe think it's worth it to do a new product-pass on this with fresh eyes, and explore what a better overall UX _could_ be. How exactly we would manage this in terms of rollout or versioning/deprecating the API itself is not in scope here.\n\n\n",

At the moment this information is only available in the Core trace logs during the transaction execution and there is no way to get it from the simulation at all. However, sometimes this information is useful both for the contract developers themselves, and also for sharing the tracing data with other developers for the sake of troubleshooting.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nSome way to request the tracing info on the user side and return it in the response. \n\nThe exact details are up to debate. This will likely require some changes from on the simulation side and maybe in the tracing framework of host, but we should figure out the output format first. We should also decide on which information we should present (e.g. env traces hashes of various internal data structures, which are useful for ensuring the protocol being unchanged, but likely not so useful as a debugging tool). On the other hand we may want to output more detailed information in place of these hashes.\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\nDon't do anything for the simulation and rely on the core trace logs. This is somewhat more limited because the simulation failures won't be covered, but OTOH tracing of the simulation failures are a small subset of a small use case. On the other hand, while the tracing seemed useful to have while troubleshooting a couple of issues, that's still just a couple of issues across all the Soroban existence timespan. So an argument can be made for not over-engineering this and focusing on providing the minimal usable functionality with the lowest time investment.",

      "body": "## Context\n\nThe `getEvents` method currently requires `topics` to be an array of arrays (i.e., `TopicFilter[]` where each `TopicFilter` is itself an array of `SegmentFilter`). This structure supports OR logic across multiple topic filters, which is powerful but creates a common source of confusion.\n\nRelated documentation issue: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-docs/issues/2077\n\n## The Problem\n\nUsers (both humans and AI agents) have reported (just anaecdotes) construct topic filters incorrectly because the nested array structure is unintuitive for the most common use case: filtering on a single topic pattern.\n\n**What users have been seen to write (incorrect):**\n```json\n\"topics\": [\n  [\"AAAADwAAAAh0cmFuc2Zlcg==\"],\n  [\"*\"],\n  [\"*\"],\n  [\"*\"]\n]\n```\n\n**What they should write (correct):**\n```json\n\"topics\": [\n  [\"AAAADwAAAAh0cmFuc2Zlcg==\", \"*\", \"*\", \"*\"]\n]\n```\n\nThe incorrect version treats each segment as a separate filter (OR'd together), when the intent was a single filter matching all four topic positions.\n\n## Proposal\n\nConsider accepting a flat array as shorthand for a single topic filter. If `topics` contains strings rather than arrays, treat it as a single `TopicFilter`.\n\n**With this change, this would also be valid:**\n```json\n\"topics\": [\"AAAADwAAAAh0cmFuc2Zlcg==\", \"*\", \"*\", \"*\"]\n```\n\nThis would be semantically equivalent to:\n```json\n\"topics\": [\n  [\"AAAADwAAAAh0cmFus2Zlcg==\", \"*\", \"*\", \"*\"]\n]\n```\n\nThis would act as a way to make the API more forgiving, without making it less powerful, and without breaking any existing uses.\n\n## Questions\n\n- Do most real world getEvents calls actually filter on a single topic pattern? Or is this \"maintainer biasis\" where maintainers are building simpler apps.\n- Is there meaningful any ambiguity this could introduce? Could the bifurcation create meaningful problems?\n- Are there other filter parameters that would benefit from similar treatment?\n\n---\n\nThis is exploratory—opening for discussion to see if this would be a worthwhile improvement to the API ergonomics. It's not clear cut to me that this is definitely what should happen here, and the docs change may be sufficient.",

We observed that committing the ingestion transaction took 1 - 1.5 seconds per ledger. This is surprising because committing the transaction should be a quick operation. It could be the case that executing `wal_checkpoint()` after each ledger is the bottleneck in the commit operation. We should experiment with running `wal_checkpoint()` at different frequencies (for example, once every 10 ledgers) to see if that improves ingestion performance.",

While we've built the features to support it, we haven't attempted to execute on that use case to validate how viable it is. It's possible that there are general performance issues for [getLedgers](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-rpc/issues/495) with or without the data lake proxy. It's possible that there are UX issues that may make this experience tough. For example, if you're trying to multi-thread/parallelize your reingstion but `endLedger` not being respective gives you weird overlap. Possible there's other things we're not thinking of. Moral of the story is, we don't want partners attempting to execute on this be the first ones to uncover any issues.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\n- Run through a mock full history reingestion via RPC/data lake proxy that a client might execute\n- Identify and capture any issues we should fix, whether they be performance/UX/etc related\n- Document how this process might work in developer docs",

Thanks! -->\n\n### What problem does your feature solve?\n\nTyping cURL commands for JSON-RPC usually requires repeatedly typing out `\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1`. It's small, but still inconvenient and repetitive.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nA small developer convenience change to relax the RPCs requirement of those fields, making requests without the `jsonrpc` and `id` fields would still succeed:\n```console\ncurl https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \\\n  -X POST \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"method\":\"getLatestLedger\"}'\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":null,\"result\":{\"id\":\"47faac885ff0808e6e5e571df704191d3e65da91b957288704e3eac5d1844045\",\"protocolVersion\":22,\"sequence\":262181}}%\n```\n\nReturning the same data than if they were provided:\n\n```console\ncurl https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \\\n  -X POST \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"getLatestLedger\"}'\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"result\":{\"id\":\"47faac885ff0808e6e5e571df704191d3e65da91b957288704e3eac5d1844045\",\"protocolVersion\":22,\"sequence\":262181}}%\n```\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\nDo nothing.\n\n### Risks\n\nThere's little to no risk in omitting the `id` field. Many commercial APIs support passing an identifier that are echoed and in my experience they are usually optional.\n\nThere's a risk in omitting the `jsonrpc` field. A developer may omit it and then experience problems if an RPC upgrades to a new version of JSON-RPC. This is largely a thereotical problem though, because there is no impending evidence that a v3 is planned ([ref](https://groups.google.com/g/json-rpc)). And any major breaking change in the RPCs API would very likely be preceded by a lot of community engagement and announcement.\n\n### Examples\n\nIn the Ethereum ecosystem that also use JSON-RPC requirements on the `jsonrpc` and `id` fields are inconsistent.\n\nFor example, Infura RPC nodes requires `id` but not `jsonrpc`. When `jsonrpc` is omitted a value is echoed back indicating the JSON-RPC version in use.\n```\n$ curl https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/APIKEY \\\n  -X POST \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"id\":1, \"method\": \"eth_blockNumber\"}'\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"result\":\"0x1529c43\"}%\n```\n\nFor example, the public Merkle RPC node requires neither, but returns empty values in response:\n```\n$ curl https://eth.merkle.io \\\n  -X POST \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"method\": \"eth_blockNumber\"}'\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"\",\"id\":null,\"result\":\"0x1529c54\"}%\n```\n\nThe inconsistent behaviours above suggest that what RPCs require with these fields is largely unimportant. And if they are unimportant, we can improve the developer experience by removing their presence as a requirement.\n\n### Related\n\n- #392 ",

      "body": "### What problem does your feature solve?\n\nWe are currently debating a potential change to the event ID encoding, due to the need to correctly order the different arrays of events that are coming out of core: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-rpc/issues/414\n\nCurrently, `id` is utilized by the `getEvents` API as a pagination cursor, so it is user-facing and derivable/interpretable by end-users. If we were to change the encoding logic, this presents two problems:\n- Mid-flight requests during deploys will fail in unexpected ways. For example, imagine a client requests events and is holding a `cursor` value. RPC then deploys a new version, with the new `event_id` encoding. The client then requests the next page of events by passing in the `cursor` value. Depending on how the encoding changes, this could either return wrong/confusing results, or just error out in some way.\n- Clients may be deriving their own cursors. Currently, `id` is returned in the events response, and it's clear that this is the same value as the `cursor`. It's possible that clients have identified this and thus may have built logic into their application assuming they can grab any `id` from any response and pass it in as the `cursor`.\n\nOther cursor/pagination problems that this could solve include:\n- Clients may send different filters/parameters on subsequent requests that contain a cursor, which could lead to confusing results. Clients also _must_ drop startLedger/endLedger parameters to pass API validation when a cursor is passed, so it's an easy mistake to make that they also drop additional filters/parameters.\n- The `endLedger` if passed, is effectively \"lost\" on the second page of a pagination session. For example, if I query events with `startLedger=1, endLedger=1, limit=5`, and there are 6 events in ledger 1, then my second request may be `cursor=<x>, limit=5` and will include events from ledger 2.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nChange our `cursor` values to be opaque to the end-user, and encode information about the query parameters of the original request in said cursor. \n\nFor example, the `cursor` could simply be a base64 encoded string representation of the following key/value pairs:\n\n```\n{\n    version: 1,\n    startLedger: ...,\n    endLedger: ...,\n    filters: ....,\n    cursor: ...\n}\n```\n This gives us a few advantages:\n- Makes us forwards-compatible against any changes we may need to make to the `cursor` values in the future. Application code could translate cursor versions across deployment boundaries. For example, if the event_id encoding switched between v1/v2, RPC could still accept v1 cursors for a time but only return v2 cursors, ensuring that clients that are mid-stream/mid-pagination are not disrupted when RPC deploys happen. It would also be possible to do this when introducing this change, as we know if the cursor looks like an old event_id encoding that it's an old cursor version. \n- Discourages end-users from assigning or deriving meaning from our cursor/event id\n- Removes the need for the client to pass in all of their filter parameters on every single request. If they have a live cursor they effectively have a stateful scroll id that they can use to continue their scrolling session.\n- Allows `endLedger` to be used.\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\n- Do nothing. It's probably unlikely that we'd need to change the event ID encoding more than once. And even if we do, it's just a temporary breakfast for clients paginating across version updates. A client that had an old `cursor` would just have to backtrack to the most recent ledger and start paging again from there. We should ensure these kinds of requests throw some error or are otherwise easily identifiable to the end-user, rather than returning real (incorrect) results.\n",

None of these are critical to be implemented, this is just a dump of potential possibilities to consider:\r\n\r\n- Return `contract_events` separately from `diagnostic_events`. Contract events are hashed into ledger and thus can be used for off-chain applications, while diagnostic events are intended for the contract and dapp developers and are not standardized and might change with time. With the clear distinction it's easier for the users to distinguish between the two, e.g. wallets could use this to tell with confidence which transfers have happened during simulation without the risk of reporting a diagnostic event that imitates a transfer.\r\n- Return `simulated_instructions/memory` in respectively named fields (with the respective documentation). These will always be populated, even in case of the failure, which could help contract developers to debug their contracts. There is also an option to explicitly return the adjusted instructions as a separate field for the ease of access)\r\n- Return `modified_entries` in the response (optionally?). These represent the states of all the writeable entries before and after the host invocation. This is important for wallets to be able to present the transaction effects to the user, but also may be a generally useful debugging tool for contract developers.\r\n- Provide configuration mechanism for Soroban RPC to configure the default simulation adjustments without recompilation. The adjustments can then be passed directly to `soroban-simulation`.\r\n- Expose the simulation adjustments to the users via request parameters\r\n- Pass lists of keys in ExtendTtl/Restore ops instead of operation body XDR - this reduces the risk of providing a bad simulation request as currently the user has to be aware that RO footprint is used for TTL extension and RW footprint is used for restoration",

So, one response might be as of ledger x, and another could be as of ledger x+1.\r\n\r\n### What would you like to see?\r\n\r\nWe should use a single database transaction for a batch.\r\n\r\nThis means we need to:\r\n- Change the jsonrpc server to so that we can detect batches instead of having them handled automatically (I assume, check the docs).\r\n  - This will mean some spelunking through the jrpc library and docs https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/creachadair/jrpc2?utm_source=godoc\r\n- Refactor the database transaction system so we can use a transaction for a whole batch.

Thanks! -->\n\n### What problem does your feature solve?\n\nOur current pipeline only pushes Docker images to **Docker Hub**. This creates a dependency on a third-party registry, leading to potential rate limits and slower pull times in GCP environments. Our composer needs to access it with credentials.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nWe need to update our GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to support the following:\n\n1.  **Dual-Push Mechanism:** For all built images, the pipeline must push to **both** the existing Docker Hub *and* the new **GCR** location in our shared registry.\n2.  **Production Image Replication:** All production-tagged images (e.g., from `main` or release branches) must also be replicated and pushed to the **GCR instance within each target Google Cloud Project** (hubble, test-hubble, etc.).\n3.  **GCR Authentication:** Update GitHub Actions with Google Service Account (GSA) credentials for proper authentication and pushing to the required GCR endpoints.\n4. Rotate docker credentials once everything is working as expected\n\n### What alternatives are there?\n\n\n\n",

The goal is that this instance will be used on adhoc basis for testing PRs etc. We do not maintain it as a continuous running instance.\n\n#### Requirements:\n\n1. Create a Staging Airflow instance `staging-hubble`\n\n2. Create a bash script which uploads all schemas and datasets from prod (for last 30 days worth of data) to staging-hubble project in bigquery. One should run this script as part of setup DAG in `staging-hubble` airflow instance.\n\nAdd deploy option to `staging` instance in stellar-etl-airflow github action\n\nCreate a bash script to clear all schemas and datasets in `staging-hubble` bigquery project. This will again will be run as part of dag/task in `staging-hubble` airflow instance\n\nNote that we should use all env variables/profile similar to that of prod to mimic the behavior entirely, unless it is not possible.\n\n#### Workflow:\n\n* The staging airflow instance is always running, while the dags are off\n\n* Developer runs setup dag in staging airflow\n\n* Developer deploy their PR on staging airflow and test\n\n* Once the testing is done, developer runs clean dag in staging airflow and turns off all the DAGs\n\n \n\n#### How staging is different from Test env:\n\n* Test uses data from testnet while staging uses subset of prod data\n\n* Test is a continuous running environment which we use to test minor or major changes. And it helps identifies issue earlier. Staging will mimic prod environment and used when major changes are required to be tested \n",

Thanks! -->\n\n### What problem does your feature solve?\n\nstellar-etl uses ledger sequence numbers to ingest and transform data in bounded batches. Currently, stellar-etl processes data in 10 min intervals. For a given batch interval, the start and end timestamps of the batch range (ie, `2025-07-01T01:00:00` and `2025-07-01T01:10:00`) are passed to a cli method, [get_ledger_range_from_times](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-etl/blob/master/cmd/get_ledger_range_from_times.go) that is able to calculate the start and end ledger sequences for the given time range. These start and end sequences are how stellar-etl operates.\n\nThe problem is that the method, `get_ledger_range_from_times`, uses the HistoryArchives to calculate the start and end ledger ranges. HistoryArchives checkpoints are written every ~5 min, but there is no guarantee that the checkpoint is written at exactly 5 min.\n\nWhenever history archives is delayed in writing a checkpoint, this impacts the way we orchestrate stellar-etl:\n- `get_ledger_range_from_times` will find the max ledger in the archives for the time range\n- history archives will be missing the last 5 min of data\n- etl processes data interval, minus the missing checkpoint\n\nWhen the next batch interval starts, the missing ledgers are not picked up because they are outside the current batch interval date range.\n\n### What would you like to see?\n\nRefactor `get_ledger_range_from_times` to find start and end sequence numbers from GCS Datastore. The rest of our ETL process depends on the GCS bucket and does not fetch any data from History Archives. This method introduces dependencies outside of a managed, hosted data lake and creates processing delays.\n\nIf we ever wanted to decrease our batch interval, this is our only dependency on checkpoints, and prevents us from moving to a near-real time, events based architecture. \n\nAnother idea is to remove this method entirely, and save ledger sequences processed outside of stellar-etl itself. (Could be a metadata table? or airflow variable?) \n\n",

      "body": "## Summary\n\nOpenZeppelin Stellar Contracts [v0.6.0](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/releases/tag/v0.6.0) introduces a new `get_existing_roles` function that returns all roles that currently have at least one member. This provides a direct on-chain method to enumerate roles without relying on indexer-based event reconstruction.\n\n## Current Implementation (Workaround)\n\nThe current `StellarAccessControlService.getCurrentRoles()` implementation uses a two-step workaround:\n\n1. **Role Discovery via Indexer**: If `knownRoleIds` aren't provided during contract registration, the adapter queries the indexer for historical `ROLE_GRANTED` and `ROLE_REVOKED` events to discover roles\n2. **Member Enumeration**: Once role IDs are known, it uses `get_role_member_count` and `get_role_member` to enumerate members\n\nThis approach has limitations:\n- Requires indexer availability for role discovery\n- Depends on historical event data being indexed\n- Adds latency due to indexer queries\n- May miss roles if indexer data is incomplete\n\n## New API from v0.6.0\n\nFrom [`storage.rs`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/blob/main/packages/access/src/access_control/storage.rs):\n\n```rust\n/// Returns a vector containing all existing roles.\n/// Defaults to empty vector if no roles exist.\n///\n/// # Arguments\n///\n/// * `e` - Access to Soroban environment.\n///\n/// # Notes\n///\n/// This function returns all roles that currently have at least one member.\npub fn get_existing_roles(e: &Env) -> Vec<Symbol> {\n    let key = AccessControlStorageKey::ExistingRoles;\n    if let Some(existing_roles) = e.storage().persistent().get(&key) {\n        e.storage().persistent().extend_ttl(&key, ROLE_TTL_THRESHOLD, ROLE_EXTEND_AMOUNT);\n        existing_roles\n    } else {\n        Vec::new(e)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Return type**: `Vec<Symbol>` - A vector of role symbols (identifiers)\n\n## Proposed Implementation\n\n### 1. Add on-chain reader function\n\nAdd `getExistingRoles()` function in `packages/adapter-stellar/src/access-control/onchain-reader.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nexport async function getExistingRoles(\n  contractAddress: string,\n  networkConfig: StellarNetworkConfig\n): Promise<string[]>\n```\n\n### 2. Update feature detection\n\nAdd `get_existing_roles` to feature detection in `packages/adapter-stellar/src/access-control/feature-detection.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nconst hasExistingRolesFunction = !!functions.find(\n  (f) => f.name === 'get_existing_roles'\n);\n```\n\n### 3. Update service to prefer new method\n\nModify `StellarAccessControlService.getCurrentRoles()` to:\n\n1. Check if contract supports `get_existing_roles` (via feature detection)\n2. If supported, call `get_existing_roles` to get role IDs directly\n3. If not supported, fall back to current indexer-based discovery\n4. Continue using `get_role_member_count` and `get_role_member` for member enumeration\n\n### 4. Fallback Strategy\n\nThe current indexer-based role discovery should remain as a fallback for:\n- Contracts deployed before v0.6.0 that don't have `get_existing_roles`\n- Edge cases where on-chain call fails\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Add `getExistingRoles` on-chain reader function\n- [ ] Update feature detection to check for `get_existing_roles`\n- [ ] Modify `getCurrentRoles` to prefer `get_existing_roles` when available\n- [ ] Keep existing indexer-based discovery as fallback\n- [ ] Add unit tests for the new function\n- [ ] Update documentation/comments\n\n## References\n\n- [Stellar Contracts v0.6.0 Release](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/releases/tag/v0.6.0)\n- [storage.rs source](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/blob/main/packages/access/src/access_control/storage.rs)",

      "body": "## Problem Description\n\nThe \"Load Contract\" step in the UI Builder wizard has a field dependency issue that prevents users from progressing to the next step if they don't fill required fields in a specific top-down sequence.\n\n### Affected Adapter\nThis issue is most clearly manifested in the **Midnight adapter**, which requires three fields:\n1. Contract Address\n2. Private State ID  \n3. Contract Artifacts ZIP file\n\n### Expected Behavior\nUsers should be able to fill these fields in **any order** and have the contract parsing trigger automatically once all required fields are present, enabling the Next button.\n\n### Actual Behavior\nThe Next button only enables (and parsing only triggers) if fields are filled in this exact sequence:\n1. Address → 2. Private State ID → 3. Artifacts ZIP\n\nIf fields are filled in a different order (e.g., Artifacts ZIP → Private State ID → Address), the parsing does not trigger and the Next button remains disabled, preventing progression.\n\n### Impact\n- **User Experience**: Users are forced to follow a specific field-filling order, which is unintuitive and frustrating\n- **Scope**: While most evident in the Midnight adapter, this may be a UI Builder-wide issue affecting any adapter with multiple required contract definition inputs\n\n## Technical Context\n\n### Key Components Involved\n- `useAutoContractLoad` hook - triggers automatic contract loading based on form state changes\n- `useFormSync` hook - synchronizes form values to the store and manages the `needsContractDefinitionLoad` flag\n- `hasMissingRequiredContractInputs` utility - validates that all adapter-declared required inputs are present\n- Form validation logic that checks `formState.isValid` and required field presence\n\n### Relevant Files\n- `packages/builder/src/components/UIBuilder/StepContractDefinition/hooks/useAutoContractLoad.ts`\n- `packages/builder/src/components/UIBuilder/StepContractDefinition/hooks/useFormSync.ts`\n- `packages/builder/src/components/UIBuilder/StepContractDefinition/hooks/useContractForm.ts`\n- `packages/utils/src/contractInputs.ts`\n\n## Requirements for Fix\n\nThe fix must work correctly in **all scenarios**:\n\n1. **Fresh submission**: User fills fields in any order → parsing triggers when all fields are complete\n2. **Later amendments**: User changes previously entered values → parsing re-triggers appropriately without breaking reactivity\n\n### Critical Constraints\n- Must not break existing reactivity when users modify already-entered values\n- Must maintain proper debouncing behavior to avoid excessive API calls\n- Must preserve the circuit breaker logic that prevents duplicate loads\n- Must handle edge cases like form resets, network changes, and configuration loading\n\n## Investigation Needed\n\nA thorough analysis is required to understand:\n1. Why the `needsContractDefinitionLoad` flag is not being set correctly when fields are filled out of order\n2. How debounced values interact with the flag-setting logic\n3. Whether there are race conditions between different effects that sync form state\n4. How the validation logic determines when all required fields are present vs. when parsing should trigger\n\n## Notes\n\n- This is a delicate issue - a naive fix could break reactivity in amendment scenarios\n- The issue may affect other adapters beyond Midnight, so the fix should be chain-agnostic\n- No solution should be assumed until thorough analysis is complete\n",

      "body": "# Next button remains disabled after applying new artifacts in Midnight adapter\n\n## Description\n\nWhen a user reloads a saved configuration with trimmed artifacts and uploads a new ZIP file to select a different function, the \"Reload contract\" button appears correctly. However, after clicking this button to apply the new artifacts, the main \"Next\" button of the wizard remains disabled, preventing the user from proceeding to the next step.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Create a Midnight contract configuration with a large artifacts ZIP file (>15MB threshold)\n2. Select a function, which triggers artifact trimming (ZIP is not saved due to performance reasons)\n3. Save the configuration\n4. Reload the page and open the saved configuration\n5. Navigate back to the contract loading step of the UI wizard\n6. Observe the notification that the artifact ZIP was not saved and needs to be provided again\n7. Upload the ZIP file again\n8. Observe that the system detects artifacts have changed and shows a \"Reload contract\" button\n9. Click the \"Reload contract\" button\n10. Observe that the contract reloads successfully, but the \"Next\" button remains disabled\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nAfter clicking \"Reload contract\" and successfully reloading the contract with the new artifacts, the \"Next\" button should become enabled, allowing the user to proceed to the function selector step.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nThe \"Next\" button remains disabled after successfully reloading the contract, even though:\n- The contract schema is loaded successfully\n- The new artifacts (including `originalZipData`) should be present\n- The `requiresManualReload` flag should be cleared\n\n## Technical Context\n\nThe wizard step validation logic is:\n```typescript\nisValid: !!state.contractState.schema && !isTrimmedOnly\n```\n\nWhere `isTrimmedOnly` is computed as:\n```typescript\nconst hasTrimmed = !!(artifacts as Record<string, unknown>)?.['trimmedZipBase64'];\nconst hasOriginal = !!(artifacts as Record<string, unknown>)?.['originalZipData'];\nreturn hasTrimmed && !hasOriginal;\n```\n\nThe issue likely stems from one of the following:\n1. The `originalZipData` field is not being properly set in `contractDefinitionArtifacts` after reload\n2. The `contractState.schema` is not being set correctly after reload\n3. The validation check is not re-evaluating after the state update\n4. The artifact re-application logic is failing silently\n\n## Environment\n\n- Adapter: Midnight (`@openzeppelin/contracts-ui-builder-adapter-midnight`)\n- Artifact size: Large ZIP files (>15MB threshold for deferred persistence)\n- Configuration state: Saved configuration with trimmed artifacts\n\n## Related Code Areas\n\n- `packages/builder/src/components/UIBuilder/StepContractDefinition/StepContractDefinition.tsx` - Manual reload handler\n- `packages/builder/src/components/UIBuilder/StepContractDefinition/hooks/useContractLoader.ts` - Contract loading logic\n- `packages/builder/src/components/UIBuilder/hooks/uiBuilderStore.ts` - State management and `setContractDefinitionResult`\n- `packages/adapter-midnight/src/adapter.ts` - `loadContractWithMetadata` method\n- `packages/adapter-midnight/src/utils/artifacts.ts` - Artifact validation and conversion\n- `packages/adapter-midnight/src/contract/loader.ts` - `loadMidnightContractWithMetadata` return value\n\n",

This is correct for EOA flows, but unnecessarily strict for relayer flows:\n- EVM relayer: does not require a connected wallet.\n- Stellar relayer: requires a wallet only when feeBump is enabled (inner tx signing); otherwise not required.\n\n## Problem\nTwo places enforce a hard wallet requirement:\n- `packages/renderer/src/components/transaction/TransactionExecuteButton.tsx` disables the button when `!isWalletConnected`.\n- `packages/renderer/src/components/TransactionForm.tsx` aborts submission when `!isWalletConnected`.\n\nThis breaks the principle of keeping chain-specific behavior within adapters and prevents valid relayer flows without a wallet.\n\n## Proposal\nIntroduce adapter-led runtime capability: let adapters indicate when a connected wallet is required for the current `ExecutionConfig`.\n\n- Add optional contract adapter method:\n  - `requiresConnectedWallet(executionConfig: ExecutionConfig): boolean`\n    - Default: `true` for safety when not implemented.\n    - EVM adapter: returns `executionConfig.method === \"eoa\"`.\n    - Stellar adapter: returns `executionConfig.method === \"eoa\" || (executionConfig.method === \"relayer\" && !!transactionOptions?.feeBump)`.\n\n- Update renderer gating:\n  - `TransactionForm` submission guard uses `adapter.requiresConnectedWallet(executionConfig)`.\n  - `TransactionExecuteButton` disabled state uses the same boolean, passed down as a prop.\n\n- Keep existing relayer API key validation unchanged.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Executing via EVM relayer without wallet is allowed (with valid API key).\n- Executing via Stellar relayer without wallet is allowed when `feeBump` is false; blocked when `feeBump` is true.\n- Executing via EOA remains blocked without wallet.\n- No chain-specific logic lives in the renderer; decisions come from adapters.\n- Types package updated to include the optional method and lint rule `@no-extra-adapter-methods.cjs` kept in sync.\n\n## Notes\n- This preserves the chain-agnostic and adapter-led architecture.\n- Backward compatible: adapters not implementing the method default to current behavior (require wallet).\n\n",

Which means subtle changes in code could be missed. Whereas if we had an object as input this would most likely never happen without being noticed.\n\nThis task is about moving `all functions` to the `single-object-input pattern` and follow this code convention moving forwards.\n\nSince this refactor would result in lots of `BREAKING CHANGES` it seems to merit a `2.0` release.\n",
